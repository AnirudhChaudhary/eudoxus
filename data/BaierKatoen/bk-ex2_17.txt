Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the traffic lights switch completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by pedestrians who would like to cross the road.

Model these lights as a simple transition system with two states, one state modeling a red light, the other one modeling a green light.
