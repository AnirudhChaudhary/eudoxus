Model a preliminary design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda.

The state space is S = { pay , select , soda , beer }. The set of initial states consists of only one state, i.e., I = { pay }. The (user) action insert coin denotes the insertion of a coin, while the (machine) actions get soda and get beer denote the delivery of soda and beer, respectively.

Write an LTL property that checks that the vending machine only delivers a drink after being provided with a coin.
