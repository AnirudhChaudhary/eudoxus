Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the traffic lights switch completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by pedestrians who would like to cross the road. 

Model a parallel composition of two traffic lights. In principle, any form of interlocking of the “actions” of the two traffic lights is possible. For instance, in the initial state where both traffic lights are red, there is a non-deterministic choice between which of the lights turns green. Note that this nondeterminism is descriptive, and does not model a scheduling problem between the traffic lights (although it may seem so).
