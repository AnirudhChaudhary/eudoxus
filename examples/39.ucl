// Purpose: test that module instance names can shadow module declaration names
// Description: Two modules. The first is empty and called "a". The second creates an instance called "a" of module "a."
// Expectation: UCLID5 should accept this input
// Validation: disallowing instances to have the same name as modules would be a breaking change 

module a {}

module main {
    instance a: a();
}
