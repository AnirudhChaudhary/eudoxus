// Purpose: tests that the bmc command does not ignore not LTL properties
// Description: A simple module that has one variable, initialised at one. The next block increments the variable by 1 each time, and a global invariant checks that n is not equal to 0. The property is checked using the bmc command.
// Expectation: UCLID5 should report that a number of assertions pass
// Validation: Revert PR #131, or remove the line in symbolic simulator that does symbolic simulation for bmc.
