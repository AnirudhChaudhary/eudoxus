//Purpose: tests that we throw a parser error when the verify command does not have a close parenthesis
//Description: a module with a control block that uses the verify command but fails to close the parenthesis.
//Expectation: Error message includes the correct line
//Validation: none needed. If the correct error message is thrown, the test is valid

module main {
    control {
        v1 = induction(1);
        v2 = verify(
