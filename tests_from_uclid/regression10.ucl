// Purpose: Tests that groups can be imported 
// Description: The module has two modules. One module defines a group of integers, containing 0,1,2 and 3. The second module imports the group from the first module, and has a property that asserts that the first member of the group is equal to 0.
// Expectation: this should parse (but it doesn't)
// Validation: Would need to write a group import pass to make this pass.

module m1 {
    group myGroup : integer = {0, 1, 2, 3};
}

module main {
    group * = m1.*;


    control {
        v = unroll(0);
        check;
        print_results;
    }
}
