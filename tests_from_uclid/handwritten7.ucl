// Purpose: tests shadowing between record field names and variable names
// Description: A single module. The module defines a record type t with an integer field named x. It also defines a variable x of type t. The init block then uses an inline assertion to assert that x.x is equal to x.x. 
// Expectation: The module should parse correctly
// Validation: revert the commits in here: https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid/pull/189
// Comment: based roughly on issue99

module main {
  type t = record {
    x : integer
  };
  var x : t;

  init{
    assert(x.x == x.x);
  }
}
