====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the described parking garage system in UCLID5, we will create a system that includes modules for detecting car arrivals and departures, a module for counting cars, and a module to integrate these components and manage the state updates. Here's an outline of how the UCLID5 model could be structured:

--OUTLINE--

### 1. Modules Description

#### ArrivalDetector Module
- **Purpose**: Detects the arrival of cars.
- **Input**: None (assumes an external trigger).
- **Output**: `arrival` (boolean) - signals when a car arrives.

#### DepartureDetector Module
- **Purpose**: Detects the departure of cars.
- **Input**: None (assumes an external trigger).
- **Output**: `departure` (boolean) - signals when a car departs.

#### Counter Module
- **Purpose**: Maintains and updates the count of cars in the garage.
- **Input**:
  - `arrival` (boolean) - input from ArrivalDetector.
  - `departure` (boolean) - input from DepartureDetector.
- **Output**: `counter` (integer) - current count of cars in the garage.
- **Internal State**:
  - `count` (integer) - stores the current number of cars.
- **Behavior**:
  - Initialize `count` with an initial value `i`.
  - Increment `count` on receiving an `arrival` event.
  - Decrement `count` on receiving a `departure` event.
  - Output the updated `count` as `counter`.

#### Main Module
- **Purpose**: Integrates all modules and controls the flow of data between them.
- **Behavior**:
  - Instantiate modules: ArrivalDetector, DepartureDetector, and Counter.
  - Route the outputs of ArrivalDetector and DepartureDetector to the inputs of the Counter module.
  - Update the display based on the output from the Counter module.

### 2. Model Configuration and Control
- **Initial State Configuration**:
  - Set the initial value of `count` in the Counter module to `i`.
  - Ensure that both `arrival` and `departure` are initially false.
- **State Transition**:
  - Define transitions based on the occurrence of `arrival` and `departure` events.
  - Update the `counter` output in the Counter module in response to these events.
- **Assertions and Invariants**:
  - Assert that the `count` never becomes negative.
  - Verify that the `counter` output always matches the number of cars computed from the events.

### 3. Verification and Properties
- **Safety Properties**:
  - The count of cars (`count`) should never be negative.
  - The output `counter` should always accurately reflect the number of cars in the garage.
- **Liveness Properties**:
  - Every `arrival` event eventually leads to an increment in the `counter`.
  - Every `departure` event eventually leads to a decrement in the `counter`.

### 4. Simulation and Testing
- **Test Cases**:
  - Simulate a sequence of arrivals and departures to ensure the counter updates correctly.
  - Test edge cases such as rapid consecutive arrivals or departures.
- **Counterexamples**:
  - Generate scenarios where the assumptions about the arrival and departure signals might lead to incorrect counts (e.g., simultaneous arrival and departure).

This outline sets the stage for implementing a robust UCLID5 model to simulate and verify the functionality of a parking garage system, ensuring accurate tracking of car counts through arrivals and departures.

assistant :: // Arrival detector module.
module ArrivalDetector {
    output arrival : boolean;
    next {
        // Car arrives with probability 0.9.
        arrival' = (arrival || (arrival == false) && (rand(0, 10) < 9));
    }
}

// Departure detector module.
module DepartureDetector {
    output departure : boolean;
    next {
        // Car departs with probability 0.9.
        departure' = (departure || (departure == false) && (rand(0, 10) < 9));
    }
}

// Counter module.
module Counter {
    input arrival : boolean;
    input departure : boolean;
    output counter : integer;
    var count : integer;

    init {
        count = 0;
    }
    next {
        if (arrival) {
            count' = count + 1;
        }

            count' = count - 1;
        }
        counter' = count;
    }
}

// Main module.
module System {
    instance ad : ArrivalDetector();
    instance dd : DepartureDetector();
    instance co : Counter(arrival : (ad.arrival), departure : (dd.departure));
    input i : integer;
    output counter : integer;
    init {
        assume (i >= 0);
        // Initialize the counter with i.
        next (co) = (counter : i);
        // Ensure that no car arrives or departs initially.
        next (ad, dd) = (arrival : false, departure : false);
    }
    next {
        // Route the outputs of the arrival and departure detectors to the counter.
        next (co) = (arrival : ad.arrival, departure : dd.departure);
        // Update the display based on the counter.
        next (counter) = co.counter;
    }
    // Safety properties.
    // The count should never be negative.
    invariant (co) = (co.counter >= 0);
    // The output should always match the number of cars computed from the events.
    invariant (co) = (co.counter == (ad.arrival_count + dd.departure_count));
    // Liveness properties.
    // Every arrival eventually increments the counter.
    property (co) = (ad.arrival_count == 0) || (ad.arrival);
    // Every departure eventually decrements the counter.
    property (co) = (dd.departure_count == 0) || (dd.departure);
}

// Control block.
control {
    // Test the system.
    test;
    // Print counterexamples.
    test.print_cex(ad.arrival, dd.departure, co.counter, ad.arrival_count, dd.departure_count);
}
