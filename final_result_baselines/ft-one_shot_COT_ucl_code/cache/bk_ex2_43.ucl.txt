====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the synchronous composition of circuits C1 and C2 in UCLID5, we need to define the behavior of each circuit and how they interact within a single model. Here's an outline of the UCLID5 model for this task:

--OUTLINE--

**Model Structure:**
1. **Type Definitions**: Define the basic types used in the model, typically Boolean in this context since the circuit involves binary variables.
2. **State Variables**: Declare the output, input, and register variables for both circuits.
3. **Initialization**: Specify the initial conditions for the output and register variables.
4. **Transition Relation**: Define how the state variables change from one state to the next based on the control functions.
5. **Invariant Properties**: (Optional) Define any invariant properties that should hold true for all states, if necessary.
6. **Control Block**: Specify the parameters for model checking, such as the number of steps to unroll in the bounded model checking.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Type Definitions**
   - Since all variables are binary, we use the Boolean type for `y1`, `r1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `r2`.

2. **State Variables**
   - Declare `y1` and `r1` for Circuit C1.
   - Declare `x2`, `y2`, and `r2` for Circuit C2.

3. **Initialization**
   - Initialize `r1`, `y1`, `r2`, and `y2` to some Boolean values (e.g., `false`). The initial value of `x2` might be non-deterministic or set to a specific value depending on the model requirements.

4. **Transition Relation**
   - For Circuit C1:
     - `y1' = r1`: In the next state, `y1` becomes the current value of `r1`.
     - `r1' = !r1`: In the next state, `r1` toggles its current value.
   - For Circuit C2:
     - `y2' = x2 OR r2`: In the next state, `y2` is the logical OR of the current values of `x2` and `r2`.
     - `r2' = x2 OR r2`: In the next state, `r2` becomes the logical OR of the current value of `x2` and itself.

5. **Invariant Properties** (Optional)
   - Define properties like `y1` should always follow `r1` or the consistency between `y2` and `r2` based on `x2`. These are not strictly necessary but can be useful for verifying specific behaviors.

6. **Control Block**
   - Set up the parameters for bounded model checking. Specify the depth of unrolling (e.g., 10 cycles) and any specific conditions or properties to check.

**Example UCLID5 Code Snippet:**
```uclid
module main {
  type boolean_t = boolean;
  input x2 : boolean_t;
  var y1, r1, y2, r2 : boolean_t;

  init {
    r1 = false;
    y1 = false;
    r2 = false;
    y2 = false;
  }

  next {
    y1 = r1;
    r1 = !r1;
    y2 = x2 | r2;
    r2 = x2 | r2;
  }

  control {
    check;
    print_results;
  }
}
```

This model sets up the basic structure and behavior of the circuits C1 and C2, allowing for the exploration of their synchronous composition through simulation and verification.

assistant :: module main {
  type boolean_t = boolean;
  input x2 : boolean_t;
  var y1, r1, y2, r2 : boolean_t;

  init {
    r1 = false;
    y1 = false;
    r2 = false;
    y2 = false;
  }

  next {
    y1 = r1;
    r1 = !r1;
    y2 = x2 | r2;
    r2 = x2 | r2;
  }

  control {
    check;
    print_results;
  }
}
