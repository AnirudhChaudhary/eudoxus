system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the classic ferryman, goat, cabbage, and wolf problem in UCLID5, we need to outline the following components:

1. **State Variables**: These variables will represent the location of the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage, the wolf, and what the ferryman is carrying in the boat.

2. **Initial State**: Define the starting conditions where all entities are on one side of the river.

3. **Transition Relation**: Specify the rules governing how the ferryman and any accompanying item can move from one side of the river to the other.

4. **Safety Conditions**: Define the conditions under which the goat can coexist with the cabbage or the wolf without the ferryman's supervision.

5. **Goal State**: Identify the state in which all entities are safely transported to the opposite side of the river.

6. **Property to Check**: Verify if the goal state is reachable without violating any safety conditions.

--OUTLINE--

### State Variables
- `ferryman: {left, right}`: Indicates the current side of the river where the ferryman is.
- `goat: {left, right}`: Indicates the current side of the river where the goat is.
- `cabbage: {left, right}`: Indicates the current side of the river where the cabbage is.
- `wolf: {left, right}`: Indicates the current side of the river where the wolf is.
- `carry: {none, goat, cabbage, wolf}`: Indicates what the ferryman is currently carrying in the boat.

### Initial State
- `ferryman = left`
- `goat = left`
- `cabbage = left`
- `wolf = left`
- `carry = none`

### Transition Relation
- The ferryman can move from one side to the other (`left` to `right` or `right` to `left`).
- The ferryman can carry one item or none across the river.
- The item being carried changes its side along with the ferryman.
- Items not being carried do not change sides.

### Safety Conditions
- If the ferryman is not on the same side as the goat, then the goat cannot be on the same side as the cabbage or the wolf.
  - `(ferryman != goat) -> ((goat != cabbage) && (goat != wolf))`

### Goal State
- `ferryman = right`
- `goat = right`
- `cabbage = right`
- `wolf = right`

### Property to Check
- Check if it is possible to reach the goal state from the initial state without violating any safety conditions.
- Using a reachability query, assert that the goal state is achievable:
  - `assert reachable (ferryman = right && goat = right && cabbage = right && wolf = right);`

### Model Checking
- Use bounded model checking to explore the state space and verify the property.
- Optionally, implement a counterexample trace to understand any scenario where the property fails.

This outline serves as a blueprint for implementing the ferryman puzzle in UCLID5, providing a clear structure for modeling, simulating, and verifying the solution to the problem.
