====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

Hereâ€™s a structured outline for creating a UCLID5 model for the thermostat system as described:

### Model Outline

#### 1. **Module Definitions**
   - **Thermostat Module**: This will encapsulate the behavior of the thermostat controlling the heater based on temperature readings.

#### 2. **State Variables**
   - `temp`: An integer representing the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
   - `heatOn`: A boolean indicating whether the heater is on.
   - `time`: An integer tracking the time since the last state change in seconds.

#### 3. **Initialization**
   - `temp` is initialized based on an unspecified initial condition (could be an input or a constant).
   - `heatOn` is initialized to `false`.
   - `time` is initialized to `0`.

#### 4. **State Transition Function**
   - The function will update `heatOn` and `time` based on the current `temp` and `time`.
   - **Conditions**:
     - If `heatOn` is `true` and `time` is at least 30 seconds:
       - If `temp` > 20, then set `heatOn` to `false` and reset `time` to `0`.
     - If `heatOn` is `false` and `time` is at least 120 seconds:
       - If `temp` <= 20, then set `heatOn` to `true` and reset `time` to `0`.
   - **Time Increment**:
     - Increment `time` by 30 seconds in each transition, representing the system's reaction every 30 seconds.

#### 5. **Invariants**
   - Ensure `time` is always a multiple of 30 to maintain the system's discrete time steps.
   - Ensure `heatOn` cannot toggle more frequently than the specified minimum durations (30 seconds when turning off, 120 seconds when turning on).

#### 6. **Safety Properties**
   - **Property 1**: If the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius for more than 30 seconds, `heatOn` should be `false`.
   - **Property 2**: If the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius or less for more than 120 seconds, `heatOn` should be `true`.

#### 7. **Control Flow**
   - **Model Checking**:
     - Use bounded model checking to verify the safety properties over a simulated period.
   - **Counterexamples**:
     - Generate counterexamples if any safety property is violated, showing the sequence of states leading to the violation.

#### 8. **Simulation and Testing**
   - Define a series of test scenarios with varying initial temperatures and sequences of temperature changes to validate the model behavior under different conditions.
   - Use assertions within these scenarios to ensure that the thermostat behaves as expected.

### Implementation Notes
- Ensure that the model accurately reflects the physical constraints of the thermostat and heater system.
- Consider edge cases such as rapid fluctuations around the temperature threshold (20 degrees Celsius).
- Use UCLID5's capabilities for handling non-deterministic inputs (like temperature changes) to simulate different environmental conditions.

This outline provides a structured approach to modeling the thermostat system in UCLID5, ensuring clarity in state management and transitions, as well as rigor in verifying the system's safety and correctness.
====================
assistant :: module thermostat
{
    var temp : integer;
    var heatOn : boolean;
    var time : integer;

    init {
        // unknown initial temp
        assume (temp >= 0 && temp <= 100);
        heatOn = false;
        time = 0;
    }

    next {
        if (heatOn) {
            if (time >= 30) {
                if (temp > 20) {
                    heatOn' = false;
                    time' = 0;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (time >= 120) {
                if (temp <= 20) {
                    heatOn' = true;
                    time' = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        time' = time + 30;
    }

    invariant time_step: time % 30 == 0;
    invariant min_duration: time < 30 || (heatOn && temp <= 20) || (!heatOn && temp > 20);

    // safety properties
    // if the temperature is above 20 degrees for more than 30 seconds, the heater should be off
    // if the temperature is 20 degrees or below for more than 120 seconds, the heater should be on
    property property1: (temp > 20 && heatOn) ==> (time < 30);
    property property2: (temp <= 20 && !heatOn) ==> (time < 120);

    control
    {
        v = bmc(10);
        check;
        v.print_cex(temp, heatOn, time);
    }
}

    instance t : thermostat();

    // Test 1: Start at 15, then go to 25

        t.temp = 15;

    }
    next {
        next(t);
        assert t.heatOn == true;
    }

    // Test 3: Start at 15, then go to 25, then go to 15
    init {
        t.temp = 15;
    }
    next {
        next(t);
        next(t);
        assert t.heatOn == false;
    }

    // Test 4: Start at 25, then go to 15, then go to 25
    init {
        t.temp = 25;
    }
    next {
        next(t);
        next(t);
        assert t.heatOn == true;
    }

    // Test 5: Start at 15, then go to 15
    init {
        t.temp = 15;
    }
    next {
        next(t);
        assert t.heatOn == false;
    }

    // Test 6: Start at 25, then go to 25
    init {
        t.temp = 25;
    }
    next {
        next(t);
        assert t.heatOn == true;
    }
