user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Below is an outline of how to model a preliminary design of a beverage vending machine in UCLID5, including the use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to verify a property of the system.

**1. Model Components:**

- **State Space (S)**: The states of the vending machine are represented by an enumeration type `state_t` with values `pay`, `select`, `soda`, and `beer`.
- **Initial State (I)**: The initial state of the machine is `pay`.
- **Actions**: User actions and machine actions are modeled as events or transitions within the state machine:
  - **User Actions**:
    - `insert_coin`: Transition from `pay` to `select`.
  - **Machine Actions**:
    - `get_soda`: Transition from `select` to `soda`.
    - `get_beer`: Transition from `select` to `beer`.

**2. Variables:**
- `current_state`: A variable of type `state_t` to hold the current state of the machine.
- Auxiliary variables (if needed) to facilitate the verification of properties.

**3. Transitions:**
- Define transitions based on the user and machine actions:
  - From `pay` to `select` on `insert_coin`.
  - From `select` to `soda` on `get_soda`.
  - From `select` to `beer` on `get_beer`.
- Ensure transitions are well-defined and only occur under appropriate conditions.

**4. LTL Property:**
To verify that the machine only delivers a drink after receiving a coin, we can use the following LTL property:
- **Property**: Always, if a drink is delivered (`soda` or `beer`), then previously a coin must have been inserted.
- **LTL Formula**: `G((current_state = soda || current_state = beer) -> X(previous_state = select && X(previous_state = pay)))`

This formula uses the `G` (globally) operator to specify that the condition must hold at all times. The `X` (next) operator is used to refer to the state of the system in the previous step, ensuring that before reaching `soda` or `beer`, the machine was in `select`, and before that, it was in `pay`.

**5. Model Checking:**
- Set up the UCLID5 model to check this LTL property.
- Use UCLID5's model checking capabilities to verify whether the property holds across all possible paths of execution.

**6. Simulation and Counterexamples:**
- If the property is violated, use UCLID5's functionality to generate counterexamples.
- Analyze these counterexamples to understand under what conditions the property fails.

**7. Adjustments and Iterations:**
- Based on the findings from model checking and counterexamples, refine the model or the property as necessary.
- Iterate the process to enhance the accuracy of the model and the validity of the properties being checked.

This outline sets the stage for implementing and verifying a vending machine model in UCLID5, ensuring that the system behaves as expected according to the specified properties.
