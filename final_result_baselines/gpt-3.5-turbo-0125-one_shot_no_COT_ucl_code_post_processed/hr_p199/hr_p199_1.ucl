In this model, the `cross_ferry` procedure is used to update the state variables when the ferryman crosses the river with a specific object. The `check_conflict` procedure is used to ensure that conflicts do not occur between the goat and cabbage, and the goat and wolf.

The `goal` statement defines the desired state where all objects are on the right side of the river. The `transition` block specifies the behavior of the ferryman when on the left side of the river.

This model can be used to verify if it is possible to transport all goods to the other side without any conflicts occurring.
