In this code, we have a shared variable `x` of type integer. We define two procedures `action_A` and `action_B` that modify the shared variable `x` according to the instructions `x := 2*x` and `x := x + 1` respectively. The initial value of `x` is set to 3. In the `next` block, we specify that either `action_A` or `action_B` can be executed in parallel.
