In this model, the shared variable `x` is modified by two procedures `action_A` and `action_B` which correspond to the actions A and B in the parallel program respectively. The `init` block initializes the variable `x` to 3. The `next` block specifies that either `action_A` or `action_B` can be executed in each step of the transition system.
