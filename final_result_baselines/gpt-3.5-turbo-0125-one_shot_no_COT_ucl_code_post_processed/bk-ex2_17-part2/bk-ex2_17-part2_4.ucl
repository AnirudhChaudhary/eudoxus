In this model, we have two traffic lights represented by the variables `state1` and `state2`, each having states `RED` and `GREEN`. The initial state for both traffic lights is `RED`. The transition function models the behavior of the traffic lights, where they can switch between `RED` and `GREEN` states independently of each other. The non-deterministic choice in the initial state allows for either traffic light to turn green first.
