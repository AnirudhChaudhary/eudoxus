In this model, the vending machine keeps track of the number of coins inserted (`coin`) and the number of drinks dispensed (`dispensed_drinks`). The transition rule simulates inserting a coin and dispensing a drink if enough coins are inserted. The safety property `coins_geq_drinks` ensures that the number of inserted coins is always at least the number of dispensed drinks.

The main module instantiates the vending machine module and includes the safety property in the control section for verification. The model is unrolled for 10 steps to check the safety property.
