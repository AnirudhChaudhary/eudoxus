In this model, the `vending_machine` module simulates the behavior of a beverage vending machine by allowing coins to be inserted and drinks to be dispensed based on the number of coins inserted. The `safety_property` module defines the safety property that ensures the number of inserted coins is always at least the number of dispensed drinks. The `main` module initializes the vending machine and the safety property, transitions the vending machine and safety property states, and checks the safety property at each step.
