In this code:
- The module `program` defines a boolean variable `request` and an enumeration variable `status` with values `ready` and `busy`.
- The `init` block sets the initial value of `status` to `ready`.
- The `next` block specifies that if `request` is true, the `status` transitions to `busy`, otherwise, `status` remains unchanged.
- The property `eventually_status_busy` checks that if `request` is true, eventually the `status` becomes `busy`. This is achieved by introducing an auxiliary variable `found_busy` which is used to track if the status has become busy.

This model can be used for verification to ensure that the property `eventually_status_busy` holds in the system.
