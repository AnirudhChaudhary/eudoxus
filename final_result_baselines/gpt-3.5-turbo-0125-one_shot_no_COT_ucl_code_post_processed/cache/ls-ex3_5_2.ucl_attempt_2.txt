system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  A major use of energy worldwide is in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Model a thermostat with hysteresis, which regulates temperature to maintain a setpoint, or target temperature.

It should have a state for heating and cooling. Suppose the setpoint is 20 degrees Celsius. If the heater is on, then the thermostat allows the temperature to rise past the setpoint to 22 degrees. If the heater is off, then it allows the temperature to drop past the setpoint to 18 degrees.

There is a single input temperature with type real and two pure outputs heatOn and heatOff. These outputs will be present only when a change in the status of the heater is needed (i.e., when it is on and needs to be turned off, or when it is off and needs to be turned on).

Use the variable names temp, heatOn and heatOff.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the thermostat with hysteresis:

```uclid
module thermostat
{
    var temp : real; // input temperature
    var heatOn : boolean; // output indicating heater should be turned on
    var heatOff : boolean; // output indicating heater should be turned off

    type state_t = enum { HEATING, COOLING };

    var state : state_t;
    const setpoint : real = 20.0; // target temperature
    const upperBound : real = 22.0; // upper bound for hysteresis
    const lowerBound : real = 18.0; // lower bound for hysteresis

    init {
        state = COOLING; // initial state
        heatOn = false;
        heatOff = false;
    }

    procedure update_outputs()
    {
        if (state == HEATING && temp >= upperBound) {
            heatOn = false;
            heatOff = true;
        } else if (state == COOLING && temp <= lowerBound) {
            heatOn = true;
            heatOff = false;
        } else {
            heatOn = false;
            heatOff = false;
        }
    }

    next {
        havoc temp;
        havoc state;
        update_outputs();
    }
}

```

This code models a thermostat with hysteresis that regulates temperature around a setpoint of 20 degrees Celsius. The thermostat has two outputs, `heatOn` and `heatOff`, which indicate when the heater should be turned on or off based on the current temperature and the hysteresis bounds.
