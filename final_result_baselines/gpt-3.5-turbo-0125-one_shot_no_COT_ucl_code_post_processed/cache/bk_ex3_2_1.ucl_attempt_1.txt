system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Build a model for the classic dining philosophers problem:

Five philosophers are sitting at a round table with a bowl of rice in the middle. For the philosophers (being a little unworldly) life consists of thinking and eating (and waiting, as we will see). To take some rice out of the bowl, a philosopher needs two chopsticks. In between two neighboring philosophers, however, there is only a single chopstick. Thus, at any time only one of two neighboring philosophers can eat. Of course, the use of the chopsticks is exclusive and eating with hands is forbidden.


Write a property that checks whether deadlock is possible.

Use the variable names phil1, phil2, phil3, phil4, phil5, chopstick1, chopstick2, chopstick3, chopstick4, and chopstick5

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is an Uclid5 model for the dining philosophers problem along with a property to check for deadlock:

```uclid
module dining_philosophers
{
  type state_t = enum { THINKING, HUNGRY, EATING };
  var phil1, phil2, phil3, phil4, phil5 : state_t;
  var chopstick1, chopstick2, chopstick3, chopstick4, chopstick5 : boolean;

  init {
    phil1 = THINKING; phil2 = THINKING; phil3 = THINKING; phil4 = THINKING; phil5 = THINKING;
    chopstick1 = true; chopstick2 = true; chopstick3 = true; chopstick4 = true; chopstick5 = true;
  }

  procedure take_chopsticks(p: state_t, c1: boolean, c2: boolean)
    modifies p, c1, c2;
  {
    assume(p == HUNGRY && c1 && c2);
    p = EATING;
    c1 = false;
    c2 = false;
  }

  procedure put_chopsticks(p: state_t, c1: boolean, c2: boolean)
    modifies p, c1, c2;
  {
    assume(p == EATING);
    p = THINKING;
    c1 = true;
    c2 = true;
  }

  procedure philosopher(phil: state_t, left: boolean, right: boolean)
    modifies phil, left, right;
  {
    if (phil == HUNGRY && left && right) {
      take_chopsticks(phil, left, right);
    }
    else if (phil == EATING) {
      put_chopsticks(phil, left, right);
    }
  }

  control {
    havoc phil1; havoc phil2; havoc phil3; havoc phil4; havoc phil5;
    havoc chopstick1; havoc chopstick2; havoc chopstick3; havoc chopstick4; havoc chopstick5;

    // Philosopher 1
    philosopher(phil1, chopstick5, chopstick1);
    // Philosopher 2
    philosopher(phil2, chopstick1, chopstick2);
    // Philosopher 3
    philosopher(phil3, chopstick2, chopstick3);
    // Philosopher 4
    philosopher(phil4, chopstick3, chopstick4);
    // Philosopher 5
    philosopher(phil5, chopstick4, chopstick5);
  }

  property deadlock_possible {
    !((phil1 == EATING && phil2 == EATING) ||
      (phil2 == EATING && phil3 == EATING) ||
      (phil3 == EATING && phil4 == EATING) ||
      (phil4 == EATING && phil5 == EATING) ||
      (phil5 == EATING && phil1 == EATING));
  }
}
```

This Uclid5 model simulates the dining philosophers problem with five philosophers and chopsticks. The `deadlock_possible` property checks if a deadlock is possible by ensuring that no two neighboring philosophers are in the `EATING` state simultaneously.
