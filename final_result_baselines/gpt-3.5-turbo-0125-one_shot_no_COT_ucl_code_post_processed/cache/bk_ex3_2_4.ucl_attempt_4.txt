system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Build a model for the classic dining philosophers problem:

Five philosophers are sitting at a round table with a bowl of rice in the middle. For the philosophers (being a little unworldly) life consists of thinking and eating (and waiting, as we will see). To take some rice out of the bowl, a philosopher needs two chopsticks. In between two neighboring philosophers, however, there is only a single chopstick. Thus, at any time only one of two neighboring philosophers can eat. Of course, the use of the chopsticks is exclusive and eating with hands is forbidden.


Write a property that checks whether deadlock is possible.

Use the variable names phil1, phil2, phil3, phil4, phil5, chopstick1, chopstick2, chopstick3, chopstick4, and chopstick5

====================
