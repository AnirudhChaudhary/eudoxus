system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider the following leader election algorithm: For n âˆˆ N, n processes P1,...,Pn are located in a ring topology where each process is connected by an unidirectional channel to its neighbor in a clockwise manner.

To distinguish the processes, each process is assigned a unique identifier id  in {1, . . . , n}. The aim is to elect the process with the highest identifier as the leader within the ring. Therefore each process executes the following algorithm:

send (id);
while (true) do
receive (m);
if (m = id) then stop;
if (m > id) then send (m);
od

Model the leader election protocol for n processes as a channel system.

Use the variable names m, id

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is an Uclid5 model for the leader election protocol for n processes in a ring topology:

```uclid
module leaderElection(n: int)
{
    type id_t = 1..n;
    type message_t = struct {
        m: id_t;
    };

    var channel ch: message_t;

    procedure process(id: id_t)
    {
        var m: id_t;
        send(ch, {m: id});
        while (true) {
            var msg: message_t;
            receive(ch, msg);
            m := msg.m;
            if (m == id) {
                break;
            }
            if (m > id) {
                send(ch, {m: m});
            }
        }
    }

    var processes: array[id_t] of process_id;

    init {
        for (var i: id_t) {
            processes[i] := create_process(process(i));
        }
    }
}
```

This model defines a leader election protocol for n processes in a ring topology. Each process sends its unique identifier (id) through the channel and then enters a loop where it receives messages from its neighbor. If the received message is the process's own id, it stops. If the received message has a higher id, it forwards the message. The processes are created and initialized in the `init` block.
