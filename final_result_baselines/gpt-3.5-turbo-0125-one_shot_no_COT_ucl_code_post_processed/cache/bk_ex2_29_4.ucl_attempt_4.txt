system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider a (strongly simplified) booking system at a cashier of a supermarket. The system consists of three processes: the bar code reader BCR, the actual booking program BP, and the printer Printer. The bar code reader reads a bar code and communicates the data of the just scanned product to the booking program. On receiving such data, the booking program transmits the price of the article to the printer that prints the article Id together with the price on the receipt. The interactions between the bar code reader and the booking program, and between the booking program and the printer is performed by handshaking. Each process consist of just two states, named 0 and 1.

BCR transitions from state 0 to state 1 when a bar code is scanned, and from state 1 to state 0 when the data is sent to BP.

BP transitions from state 0 to state 1 when it receives data from BCR, and from state 1 to state 0 when it sends the print command to the printer

Printer transitions from state 0 to state 1 when the print code is sent by BP, and from state 1 to state 0 when the article is printed.


The complete system is given by:
BCR || BP || Printer.

Model this system.

Use the variable names BCR_state, BP_state and Printer_state.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling the described booking system:

```
module BCR
{
    type state_t = enum { 0, 1 };

    var BCR_state : state_t;

    init {
        BCR_state = 0;
    }

    next {
        if (BCR_state == 0) {
            BCR_state' = 1;
        } else {
            BCR_state' = 0;
        }
    }
}

module BP
{
    type state_t = enum { 0, 1 };

    var BP_state : state_t;

    init {
        BP_state = 0;
    }

    next {
        if (BP_state == 0) {
            BP_state' = 1;
        } else {
            BP_state' = 0;
        }
    }
}

module Printer
{
    type state_t = enum { 0, 1 };

    var Printer_state : state_t;

    init {
        Printer_state = 0;
    }

    next {
        if (Printer_state == 0) {
            Printer_state' = 1;
        } else {
            Printer_state' = 0;
        }
    }
}

module main
{
    var BCR_state : BCR.state_t;
    var BP_state : BP.state_t;
    var Printer_state : Printer.state_t;

    init {
        BCR_state = BCR.BCR_state;
        BP_state = BP.BP_state;
        Printer_state = Printer.Printer_state;
    }

    next {
        BCR.BCR_state' = BCR_state;
        BP.BP_state' = BP_state;
        Printer.Printer_state' = Printer_state;
    }
}
```

This code models the interactions between the three processes - BCR, BP, and Printer - each with their respective states and transitions as described in the booking system. The main module orchestrates the interactions between instances of these processes.
