system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model a program that has two variables: request of type boolean and status of enumeration type {ready, busy}: 0 denotes 'false' and 1 represents 'true.'

The initial and subsequent values of variable request are not determined within this program; this conservatively models that these values are determined by an external environment. This under-specification of request implies that the value of variable status is partially determined: initially, it is ready; and it becomes busy whenever request is true. If request is false, the next value of status is not determined.

Write a property that checks that, if request is true, eventually status becomes busy. You can introduce auxiliary variables to do this.

Use the variable names request and status.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the program and checks the property:

```uclid
module program {
    type status_t = enum { ready, busy };
    var request : boolean;
    var status : status_t;

    init {
        status = ready;
    }

    next {
        if (request) {
            status' = busy;
        } else {
            // status remains unchanged if request is false
            status' = status;
        }
    }
}

module main {
    var aux_request : boolean;
    var aux_status : program.status_t;

    process p {
        var request : boolean;
        var status : program.status_t;

        init {
            request = aux_request;
            status = aux_status;
        }

        next {
            request' = request;
            status' = status;
            next program;
        }

        invariant {
            if (request) {
                eventually(status == program.status_t.busy);
            }
        }
    }

    init {
        aux_request = nondet_bool();
        aux_status = program.status_t.ready;
    }

    next {
        aux_request' = aux_request;
        aux_status' = aux_status;
        next p;
    }
}
```

In this code, the `program` module models the program with variables `request` and `status`, following the described behavior. The `main` module creates a process `p` that checks the property that if `request` is true, eventually `status` becomes `busy`. The property is specified using the `eventually` operator.
