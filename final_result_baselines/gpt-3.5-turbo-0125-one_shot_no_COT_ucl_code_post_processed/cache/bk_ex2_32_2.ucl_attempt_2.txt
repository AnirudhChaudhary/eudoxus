system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider a system essentially consisting of a sender S and a receiver R that communicate with each other over channels c and d. The receiver sends messages to the sender via channel d, and the sender sends messages to the receiver via channel c.

It is assumed that both channels have an unlimited buffer.
Channel c is unreliable in the sense that data may get lost when being transmitted from the sender S to channel c. Once messages are stored in the buffer of channel c, they are neither corrupted nor lost. Channel d is assumed to be perfect.
The goal is to design a communication protocol that ensures any distinct transmitted datum by S to be delivered to R.
To ensure this in the presence of possible message losses, sender S resorts to retransmissions.

Messages are transmitted one by one, i.e., S starts sending a new message once the transmission of the previous message has been successful. This is a simple flow control principle, known as "send-and-wait".

Each message m from S is sent with a control bit b, and when R receives this, it sends an acknowledgement consisting of the control bit it just received. On receipt of the acknowledgement, S sends a new message with the negation of the control bit.  If S has to wait too long for the acknowledgement, it times out and retransmits the original message and control bit.

Build a model of this system, using submodules for S and R.

Use the variable names c, d, S, R, m and b

====================
assistant :: Here is a Uclid5 model representing the system described:

```uclid
module channel
{
    type message_t = struct {
        m: int; // message
        b: bool; // control bit
    };

    var buffer: array[0, 1] message_t; // buffer size is 1
    var in: int; // input index
    var out: int; // output index

    procedure send(m: int, b: bool)
    {
        assume(in != out); // buffer not full
        buffer[in].m := m;
        buffer[in].b := b;
        in := in + 1;
    }

    procedure receive(m: int, b: bool)
    {
        assume(in != out); // buffer not empty
        assume(buffer[out].m == m && buffer[out].b == b);
        out := out + 1;
    }
}

module sender
{
    var m: int;
    var b: bool;

    procedure send(channel c, channel d)
    {
        c.send(m, b);
        d.receive(m, b);
    }

    procedure retransmit(channel c, channel d)
    {
        c.send(m, b);
    }

    procedure timeout(channel c, channel d)
    {
        retransmit(c, d);
    }
}

module receiver
{
    var m: int;
    var b: bool;

    procedure receive(channel c, channel d)
    {
        c.receive(m, b);
        d.send(m, b);
    }

    procedure acknowledge(channel c, channel d)
    {
        c.send(m, b);
    }
}

module main
{
    var c: channel;
    var d: channel;
    var S: sender;
    var R: receiver;

    init {
        c.in := 0;
        c.out := 0;
        d.in := 0;
        d.out := 0;
        S.m := 0;
        S.b := true;
        R.m := 0;
        R.b := true;
    }

    control
    {
        havoc S.m; havoc S.b; havoc R.m; havoc R.b; // initial values for sender and receiver
        S.send(c, d); // sender sends message
        R.receive(c, d); // receiver receives message
        R.acknowledge(c, d); // receiver acknowledges
        S.send(c, d); // sender sends new message
    }
}
```

This model defines submodules for the channel, sender, and receiver components of the system. The `channel` module represents the communication channels `c` and `d`, with functions for sending and receiving messages. The `sender` module defines procedures for sending messages, retransmitting in case of timeouts, and handling timeouts. The `receiver` module defines procedures for receiving messages and sending acknowledgments.

The `main` module initializes the channels and sender/receiver components and controls the flow of messages between the sender and receiver.
