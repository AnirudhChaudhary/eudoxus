system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model a traffic light with the usual three phases "red", "green", and "yellow".

Add assertions to check the safety property that every red phase is immediately preceded by a yellow phase. You may add auxiliary variables.

Use the variable names red, green, yellow.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code to model the traffic light with safety property assertions:

```java
module TrafficLight {
    type phase_t = enum { RED, GREEN, YELLOW };

    var red, green, yellow : phase_t;

    init {
        red = GREEN;
        green = YELLOW;
        yellow = RED;
    }

    next {
        if (red == RED) {
            assert yellow == YELLOW; // Safety property: every red phase is immediately preceded by a yellow phase
        }

        if (red == RED) {
            yellow' = YELLOW;
        } else {
            yellow' = red;
        }

        if (yellow == YELLOW) {
            red' = RED;
        } else {
            red' = yellow;
        }

        if (green == GREEN) {
            yellow' = YELLOW;
        } else {
            yellow' = green;
        }

        if (yellow == YELLOW) {
            green' = GREEN;
        } else {
            green' = yellow;
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we model the traffic light with three phases: RED, GREEN, and YELLOW. We initialize the traffic light with the phases in a specific order. The `next` block defines the state transitions for the traffic light, ensuring that the safety property is checked for every red phase being immediately preceded by a yellow phase.
