system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the traffic lights switch completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by pedestrians who would like to cross the road.

Model a parallel composition of two traffic lights. Model each traffic light as a simple transition system with two states, one state modeling a red light, the other one modeling a green light.


In principle, any form of interlocking of the "actions" of the two traffic lights is possible. For instance, in the initial state where both traffic lights are red, there is a non-deterministic choice between which of the lights turns green. Note that this nondeterminism is descriptive, and does not model a scheduling problem between the traffic lights (although it may seem so).

Use the variable names red1, green1, red2 and green 2.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the description provided:

```
module traffic_light
{
  type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };

  var state1 : state_t;
  var state2 : state_t;

  init {
    state1 = RED;
    state2 = RED;
  }

  next {
    if (state1 == RED && state2 == RED) {
      nondet {
        state1' = GREEN;
        state2' = RED;
      } else {
        state1' = RED;
        state2' = GREEN;
      }
    } else if (state1 == GREEN && state2 == RED) {
      state1' = RED;
      state2' = GREEN;
    } else if (state1 == RED && state2 == GREEN) {
      state1' = GREEN;
      state2' = RED;
    } else {
      state1' = RED;
      state2' = RED;
    }
  }
}

```

This code models a parallel composition of two traffic lights, each with two states (RED and GREEN). The initial state sets both traffic lights to RED, and then the next state logic determines the possible transitions between the states based on the current states of the two traffic lights.
