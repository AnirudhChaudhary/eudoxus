system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  You may recall the puzzle of a ferryman, goat, cabbage, and wolf all on one side of a river. The ferryman can cross the river with at most one passenger in his boat. There is a behavioural conflict between:
1. the goat and the cabbage; and
2. the goat and the wolf;
if they are on the same river bank but the ferryman crosses the river or stays on the other bank.

We wish to know how the ferryman can transport all goods to the other side, without any conflicts occurring.

Build a model in which the states represent which goods are at which side of the river. Your model will need to have variables representing the location of the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage and the wolf and a variable that indicates what is being carried in the ferry.

Define a goal state in which all goods are on the other side of the river. Write a property which checks whether this goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring.

Use the variable names ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf and carry.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Below is the Uclid5 model that represents the ferryman puzzle scenario and checks if the goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring:

```uclid
module ferryman_puzzle {

    type location_t = enum { LEFT, RIGHT }; // Enum for representing locations

    var ferryman : location_t; // Location of the ferryman
    var goat : location_t; // Location of the goat
    var cabbage : location_t; // Location of the cabbage
    var wolf : location_t; // Location of the wolf
    var carry : enum { NOTHING, GOAT, CABBAGE, WOLF }; // What is being carried in the ferry

    // Initial state
    init {
        ferryman = LEFT;
        goat = LEFT;
        cabbage = LEFT;
        wolf = LEFT;
        carry = NOTHING;
    }

    // Define the goal state where all goods are on the other side
    function goal_state() : boolean {
        return (ferryman == RIGHT) && (goat == RIGHT) && (cabbage == RIGHT) && (wolf == RIGHT);
    }

    // Define a property to check if the goal state is reachable without any conflicts
    property goal_reachable_without_conflicts() {
        // The goat and cabbage should not be left alone on the same side
        assert !((goat == cabbage) && (goat != ferryman));
        // The goat and wolf should not be left alone on the same side
        assert !((goat == wolf) && (goat != ferryman));
        // Check if the goal state is reachable
        assert goal_state();
    }

    // Define the state transition rules
    // The ferryman can carry at most one item across the river
    procedure cross_river(item : enum { GOAT, CABBAGE, WOLF }) {
        require {
            // Conditions for crossing with the goat
            if (item == GOAT) {
                assert goat == ferryman;
            }
            // Conditions for crossing with the cabbage
            if (item == CABBAGE) {
                assert cabbage == ferryman;
            }
            // Conditions for crossing with the wolf
            if (item == WOLF) {
                assert wolf == ferryman;
            }
        }
        modify {
            // Move the ferryman to the other side
            ferryman' = (ferryman == LEFT) ? RIGHT : LEFT;
            // Move the item across the river
            if (item == GOAT) {
                goat' = ferryman;
            } else if (item == CABBAGE) {
                cabbage' = ferryman;
            } else if (item == WOLF) {
                wolf' = ferryman;
            }
            // Update what is being carried in the ferry
            carry' = item;
        }
    }

    // Define the main control flow for crossing the river
    control {
        // Initial crossing with the goat
        cross_river(GOAT);
        // Second crossing with the cabbage
        cross_river(CABBAGE);
        // Third crossing with the wolf
        cross_river(WOLF);
        // Final crossing back with the goat
        cross_river(GOAT);
        // Check the property to see if the goal state is reachable without conflicts
        goal_reachable_without_conflicts();
    }
}
```

This Uclid5 model defines the ferryman puzzle scenario with the ferryman, goat, cabbage, and wolf, and ensures that the goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring.
