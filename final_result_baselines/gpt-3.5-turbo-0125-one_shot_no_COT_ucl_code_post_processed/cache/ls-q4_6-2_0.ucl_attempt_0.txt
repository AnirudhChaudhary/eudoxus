system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

assistant :: Certainly!

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model the following feature for an automobile:

Once the engine is started, a beeper is sounded and a red light warning is indicated if there are passengers that have not buckled their seat belt. The beeper stops sounding after 30 seconds, or as soon the seat belts are buckled, whichever is sooner. The warning light is on all the time the seat belt is un-buckled. Hint: Assume the sensors provide a warn event when the ignition is turned on and there is a seat with passenger not buckled in, or if the ignition is already on and a passenger sits in a seat without buckling the seatbelt. Assume further that the sensors provide a noWarn event when a passenger departs from a seat, or when the buckle is buckled, or when the ignition is turned off.

Use the variable names warn, nowarn, time, ignitian and bucked.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling the described feature for an automobile:

```java
module automobile
{
  var warn : boolean; // indicates warning light status
  var nowarn : boolean; // indicates no warning status
  var time : int; // time elapsed since warning started
  var ignition : boolean; // indicates ignition status
  var buckled : boolean; // indicates seat belt buckle status

  init {
    warn = false;
    nowarn = true;
    time = 0;
    ignition = false;
    buckled = false;
  }

  // Event definitions
  event start_engine = (ignition' == true);
  event stop_engine = (ignition' == false);
  event passenger_buckled = (buckled' == true);
  event passenger_unbuckled = (buckled' == false);

  // Rules
  rule engine_start_sound_warning {
    start_engine && !buckled && nowarn ==> {
      warn' = true;
      nowarn' = false;
      time' = 0;
    }
  }

  rule engine_start_no_warning {
    start_engine && buckled && nowarn ==> {
      warn' = false;
      nowarn' = true;
    }
  }

  rule stop_warning_when_buckled {
    passenger_buckled && warn ==> {
      warn' = false;
      nowarn' = true;
    }
  }

  rule start_warning_when_unbuckled {
    passenger_unbuckled && ignition && nowarn ==> {
      warn' = true;
      nowarn' = false;
      time' = 0;
    }
  }

  rule update_time {
    warn && time < 30 ==> {
      time' = time + 1;
    }
  }

  rule stop_warning_after_30_seconds {
    warn && time == 30 ==> {
      warn' = false;
      nowarn' = true;
    }
  }

  rule update_warning_light {
    warn ==> {
      warn' = buckled ? false : true;
    }
  }

  // System control
  control {
    start_engine;
    passenger_buckled;
    passenger_unbuckled;
    stop_engine;
  }
}
```

This code models the behavior of the automobile system as described, including the sounding of the beeper, indicating the red warning light, and the conditions for stopping the warning.
