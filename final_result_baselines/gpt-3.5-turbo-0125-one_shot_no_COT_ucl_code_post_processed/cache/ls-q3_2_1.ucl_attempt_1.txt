system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model a thermostat that controls a heater. The heater has two states: on and off.

In the initial state, if the temperature is less than or equal to 20 degrees Celsius, it turns the heater on, and leaves it on for at least 30 seconds. After that, if the temperature is greater than 20 degrees, it turns the heater off and leaves it off for at least 2 minutes. It turns it on again only if the temperature is less than or equal to 20 degrees.

Model a system that behaves as described above, assuming it reacts exactly only once every 30 seconds.

Use the variable names temp, heatOn, heatOff and time.

====================
assistant :: Here is the Uclid5 code that models the described thermostat system:

```uclid
module thermostat {
    var temp : int; // temperature in degrees Celsius
    var heatOn : boolean; // heater state - on (true) or off (false)
    var heatOff : boolean; // heater state - on (true) or off (false)
    var time : int; // time in seconds

    const THRESHOLD : int = 20; // temperature threshold for turning on/off the heater
    const MIN_ON_TIME : int = 30; // minimum time the heater stays on in seconds
    const MIN_OFF_TIME : int = 120; // minimum time the heater stays off in seconds

    init {
        temp = 18; // initial temperature
        heatOn = false; // initial heater state - off
        heatOff = true; // initial heater state - off
        time = 0; // initial time
    }

    transition {
        // Temperature update
        temp' = temp;

        // Heater state updates
        heatOn' = heatOn;
        heatOff' = heatOff;

        // Time update
        time' = time + 30; // time advances by 30 seconds

        // Transition logic
        if (temp <= THRESHOLD && !heatOn) {
            heatOn' = true; // turn on the heater
            heatOff' = false;
        } else if (temp > THRESHOLD && heatOn) {
            heatOn' = false; // turn off the heater
            heatOff' = true;
        } else if (temp <= THRESHOLD && heatOff && time >= MIN_OFF_TIME) {
            heatOn' = true; // turn on the heater after minimum off time
            heatOff' = false;
            time' = 0; // reset time
        }
    }

    invariant heat_consistency : !(heatOn && heatOff); // Heater cannot be in both on and off states simultaneously
    invariant heat_on_for_min_time : (!heatOn || time >= MIN_ON_TIME); // Heater stays on for at least 30 seconds
    invariant heat_off_for_min_time : (!heatOff || time >= MIN_OFF_TIME); // Heater stays off for at least 2 minutes
}

```

This Uclid5 model captures the behavior of the thermostat system as described, ensuring that the heater turns on and off based on the temperature conditions and time constraints specified.
