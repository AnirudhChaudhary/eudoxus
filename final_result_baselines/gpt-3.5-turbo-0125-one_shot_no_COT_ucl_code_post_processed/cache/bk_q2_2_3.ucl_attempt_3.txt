system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

assistant :: Certainly!

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  We are given three (primitive) processes P1,P2, and P3 with shared integer variable x. The program of each process is as follows:

for x = 1,...,10 do
 LOAD(x);
 INC(x);
 STORE(x);
od

That is, each process executes ten times the assignment x:=x+1.

The assignment x := x+1 is realized using the three actions LOAD(x), INC(x) and STORE(x). Consider now the parallel program:

x := 0;
P1 || P2 || P3

Build a model of the parallel program. Write a property that checks if P has an execution that halts with the terminal value x=2.

Use the variable name x

====================
assistant :: Here is the Uclid5 code that models the parallel program with processes P1, P2, and P3, and checks if there is an execution that halts with the terminal value x=2:

```
module main {
  var x : int;

  procedure LOAD(x: int) modifies x;
  procedure INC(x: int) modifies x;
  procedure STORE(x: int) modifies x;

  process P1 {
    var i : int;
    i = 1;
    do
      LOAD(x);
      INC(x);
      STORE(x);
      i = i + 1;
    od
  }

  process P2 {
    var i : int;
    i = 1;
    do
      LOAD(x);
      INC(x);
      STORE(x);
      i = i + 1;
    od
  }

  process P3 {
    var i : int;
    i = 1;
    do
      LOAD(x);
      INC(x);
      STORE(x);
      i = i + 1;
    od
  }

  init {
    x = 0;
  }

  next {
    P1;
    P2;
    P3;
  }

  invariant x_terminal_value: x == 2;
}

```

This code models the parallel program with three processes P1, P2, and P3 that execute the given sequence of operations on the shared variable x. The `x_terminal_value` invariant checks if there exists an execution where x halts with the terminal value of 2.
