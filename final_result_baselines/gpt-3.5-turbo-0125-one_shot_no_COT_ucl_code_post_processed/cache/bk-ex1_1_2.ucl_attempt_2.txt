system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Build a model of a concurrent program, in which three processes, Inc, Dec, and Reset, cooperate. They operate on the shared integer variable x with arbitrary initial value that can be accessed (i.e., read), and modified (i.e., written) by each of the individual processes.

The processes are:
proc Inc = while true do if x<200 then x:=x+1 fi od
proc Dec = while true do if x>0 then x:= xâˆ’1 fi od
proc Reset = while true do if x=200 then x:=0 fi od

Process Inc increments x if its value is smaller than 200, Dec decrements x if its value is at least 1, and Reset resets x once it has reached the value 200. They all do so repetitively.

Write an invariant that checks if the value of x is always between (and including) 0 and 200.

Use the variable name x.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling the concurrent program with the three processes Inc, Dec, and Reset, along with the invariant to check if the value of x is always between 0 and 200:

```c
module main {
  var x : int;

  process Inc {
    while true {
      if x < 200 {
        x := x + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  process Dec {
    while true {
      if x > 0 {
        x := x - 1;
      }
    }
  }

  process Reset {
    while true {
      if x == 200 {
        x := 0;
      }
    }
  }

  invariant x_between_0_and_200 {
    x >= 0 && x <= 200;
  }

  init {
    x := 100; // Initial value of x can be arbitrary
  }

  control {
    unroll(10);
    check;
    print_results;
  }
}
```

In this model, the processes Inc, Dec, and Reset continuously execute their respective actions based on the conditions provided. The invariant `x_between_0_and_200` ensures that the value of x remains between 0 and 200 (inclusive) at all times.

The `init` block initializes the shared variable x with an arbitrary initial value (in this case, 100), and the `control` block unrolls the processes for 10 steps, checks the invariant, and prints the results.
