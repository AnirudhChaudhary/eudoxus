system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model a beverage vending machine which dispenses drinks on receipt of coins.

Add a safety property that checks that the number of inserted coins is always at least the number of dispensed drinks. You may add auxiliary variables.

Use the variable names coin and dispensed_drinks

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling a beverage vending machine with the safety property you described:

```c
module vendingMachine
{
  var coin : int; // number of coins inserted
  var dispensed_drinks : int; // number of drinks dispensed

  init {
    coin = 0;
    dispensed_drinks = 0;
  }

  // Insert a coin and dispense a drink if enough coins are inserted
  procedure insert_coin_and_dispense_drink()
    modifies coin;
    modifies dispensed_drinks;
  {
    coin := coin + 1;
    if coin >= 2 {
      dispensed_drinks := dispensed_drinks + 1;
      coin := coin - 2;
    }
  }

  // Safety property: Number of inserted coins is always at least the number of dispensed drinks
  invariant safety_property {
    coin >= dispensed_drinks;
  }

  // Main control loop for vending machine
  control {
    havoc coin;
    havoc dispensed_drinks;
    insert_coin_and_dispense_drink();
  }
}
```

In this model, the vending machine keeps track of the number of coins inserted and the number of drinks dispensed. The `insert_coin_and_dispense_drink` procedure simulates inserting a coin and dispensing a drink if enough coins are inserted. The safety property `coin >= dispensed_drinks` ensures that the number of inserted coins is always at least the number of dispensed drinks. The main control loop repeatedly inserts a coin and dispenses a drink.
