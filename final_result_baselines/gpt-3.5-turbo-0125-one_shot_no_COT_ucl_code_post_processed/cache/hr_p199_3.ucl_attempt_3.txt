system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  You may recall the puzzle of a ferryman, goat, cabbage, and wolf all on one side of a river. The ferryman can cross the river with at most one passenger in his boat. There is a behavioural conflict between:
1. the goat and the cabbage; and
2. the goat and the wolf;
if they are on the same river bank but the ferryman crosses the river or stays on the other bank.

We wish to know how the ferryman can transport all goods to the other side, without any conflicts occurring.

Build a model in which the states represent which goods are at which side of the river. Your model will need to have variables representing the location of the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage and the wolf and a variable that indicates what is being carried in the ferry.

Define a goal state in which all goods are on the other side of the river. Write a property which checks whether this goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring.

Use the variable names ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf and carry.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the ferryman puzzle and checks whether the goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring:

```
module ferryman_puzzle
{
  type side_t = enum { LEFT, RIGHT };
  type item_t = enum { NONE, FERRYMAN, GOAT, CABBAGE, WOLF };

  var ferryman : side_t;
  var goat : side_t;
  var cabbage : side_t;
  var wolf : side_t;
  var carry : item_t;

  init {
    ferryman = LEFT;
    goat = LEFT;
    cabbage = LEFT;
    wolf = LEFT;
    carry = NONE;
  }

  procedure cross(item : item_t)
    modifies ferryman;
    modifies goat;
    modifies cabbage;
    modifies wolf;
    modifies carry;
  {
    if (ferryman == LEFT) {
      ferryman' = RIGHT;
      carry' = item;
      if (item == GOAT) {
        goat' = RIGHT;
      } else if (item == CABBAGE) {
        cabbage' = RIGHT;
      } else if (item == WOLF) {
        wolf' = RIGHT;
      }
    } else {
      ferryman' = LEFT;
      carry' = NONE;
      if (item == GOAT) {
        goat' = LEFT;
      } else if (item == CABBAGE) {
        cabbage' = LEFT;
      } else if (item == WOLF) {
        wolf' = LEFT;
      }
    }
  }

  transition {
    // All possible moves
    cross(NONE);
    cross(GOAT);
    cross(CABBAGE);
    cross(WOLF);
  }

  function goal_state_reached() : boolean
  {
    return (ferryman == RIGHT) && (goat == RIGHT) && (cabbage == RIGHT) && (wolf == RIGHT);
  }

  property no_conflict()
  {
    assert !( (goat == cabbage && goat != ferryman) || (goat == wolf && goat != ferryman) );
  }

  control {
    while (!goal_state_reached()) {
      next;
    }
    check no_conflict();
  }
}
```

In this model, the ferryman can cross the river with at most one item (either the goat, cabbage, or wolf). The `cross` procedure updates the states based on the item being carried. The `goal_state_reached` function checks if all items are on the right side of the river. The `no_conflict` property checks that there are no conflicts between the goat and cabbage, and between the goat and wolf, on the same side of the river. The control block iterates until the goal state is reached and checks the `no_conflict` property.
