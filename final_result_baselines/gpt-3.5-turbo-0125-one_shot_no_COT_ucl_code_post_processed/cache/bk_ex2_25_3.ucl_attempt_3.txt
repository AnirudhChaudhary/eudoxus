system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider the processes P1 and P2 with the shared variables b1, b2, and x.
b1 and b2 are Boolean variables, while x can take either the value 1 or 2, i.e., dom(x) = {1,2}. The scheduling strategy is realized using x as follows. If both processes want to enter the critical section (i.e., they are in location waiti), the value of variable x decides which of the two processes may enter its critical section: if x = i, then Pi may enter its critical section (for i = 1, 2). On entering location wait1, process P1 performs x := 2, thus giving privilege to process P2 to enter the critical section. The value of x thus indicates which process has its turn to enter the critical section. Symmetrically, P2 sets x to 1 when starting to wait. The variables bi provide information about the current location of Pi.

More precisely,

bi =waiti OR criti.

bi is set when Pi starts to wait. In pseudocode, P1 performs as follows (the code for process P2 is similar):

loop forever
.
.
.
⟨b1 := true; x := 2⟩;
wait until (x = 1 ∨ ¬b2)
do critical section od
b1 := false
.
.
.
end loop

Build a transition system that models the interleaving of P1 and P2.

Use the variable names b1, b2 and x.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the interleaving of processes P1 and P2 as described:

```uclid
module P1P2 {
    var b1: boolean;
    var b2: boolean;
    var x: 1..2; // x can take values 1 or 2

    process P1 {
        state wait1, crit1;

        init {
            state := wait1;
        }

        transition {
            wait1 -> crit1 {
                b1 := true;
                x := 2;
            }
            crit1 -> wait1 {
                b1 := false;
            }
        }
    }

    process P2 {
        state wait2, crit2;

        init {
            state := wait2;
        }

        transition {
            wait2 -> crit2 {
                b2 := true;
                x := 1;
            }
            crit2 -> wait2 {
                b2 := false;
            }
        }
    }

    init {
        b1 := false;
        b2 := false;
        x := 1; // Initially set x to 1
    }

    transition {
        // Interleaving of P1 and P2
        P1.state = wait1 && P2.state = wait2 && x == 1 -> {
            P1.state' := crit1;
        }
        P1.state = crit1 -> {
            P1.state' := wait1;
        }

        P2.state = wait2 && P1.state = wait1 && x == 2 -> {
            P2.state' := crit2;
        }
        P2.state = crit2 -> {
            P2.state' := wait2;
        }
    }
}
```

This code models the interleaving of processes P1 and P2 as described, with shared variables b1, b2, and x. The processes P1 and P2 are defined with their respective states and transitions. The main module initializes the variables and defines the interleaving transitions between P1 and P2 based on the conditions specified.
