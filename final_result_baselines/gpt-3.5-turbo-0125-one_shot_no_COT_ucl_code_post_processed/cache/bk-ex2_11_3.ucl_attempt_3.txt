system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider the circuit diagram of the sequential circuit with input variable x, output variable y, and register r.

The output variable y is given by the negation of x xor r.

The register evaluation r changes according to the circuit function next_r = x OR r.

Note that once the register evaluation is [r = 1], r keeps that value.

Model the circuit behaviour with a transition system where each state corresponds to an evaluation of x and r, and the initial valuation of r is 0.

There are two initial states:
S1: x=0, r=0
S2: x=1, r=0


Write an LTL property that checks that the output bit y is set infinitely often. You may use auxiliary variables.

Use the variable names x, y and r.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Below is the Uclid5 code that models the sequential circuit described and checks the LTL property that the output bit y is set infinitely often:

```uclid
module sequential_circuit {
    var x : boolean;
    var y : boolean;
    var r : boolean;

    init {
        r = false;
    }

    next {
        var next_r : boolean;
        next_r = x || r;
        r' = (r == true) ? r : next_r;
        y' = !(x ^ r);
    }
}

module main {
    var s1_x, s2_x : boolean;

    instance seq_circuit : sequential_circuit(x, y, r);

    init {
        s1_x = false;
        s2_x = true;
    }

    next {
        assume (s1_x == false && s2_x == true) || (s1_x == true && s2_x == false);
        seq_circuit.x = (s1_x == true) ? true : false;
        s1_x' = !s1_x;
        s2_x' = !s2_x;
        next(seq_circuit);
    }

    ltl property y_set_infinitely_often {
        exists i: 0..100 {
            always { i <= 100 -> seq_circuit.y == true }
        }
    }
}
```

This code models the sequential circuit behavior as described and checks the LTL property that the output bit y is set infinitely often. The initial states S1 and S2 are represented by the variables `s1_x` and `s2_x`. The property `y_set_infinitely_often` checks if the output bit y is set to true infinitely often within the first 100 steps of the system.
