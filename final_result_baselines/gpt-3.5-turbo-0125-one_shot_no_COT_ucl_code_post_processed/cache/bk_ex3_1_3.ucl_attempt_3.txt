system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Build a model for the parallel composition of two transition systems modelling the behaviour of traffic lights at two intersection roads.

Each traffic light can show either red or green. Both traffic lights synchronize by means of the actions A and B that indicate the change of light, e.g., action A indicates that traffic light 1 transitions from red to green, and that traffic light two transitions from green to red.

Check whether it is possible for the traffic lights to deadlock.

Use the variable names traffic_light1, traffic_light2, green1, red1, green2, red2.

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code for modeling the behavior of traffic lights at two intersection roads and checking for deadlock:

```uclid
module traffic_light1 {
  type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };

  var state : state_t;
  output green1 : boolean;
  output red1 : boolean;

  init {
    state = RED;
    green1 = false;
    red1 = true;
  }

  next {
    if (state == RED) {
      green1' = true;
      red1' = false;
    } else {
      green1' = false;
      red1' = true;
    }
  }
}

module traffic_light2 {
  type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };

  var state : state_t;
  output green2 : boolean;
  output red2 : boolean;

  init {
    state = GREEN;
    green2 = true;
    red2 = false;
  }

  next {
    if (state == RED) {
      green2' = false;
      red2' = true;
    } else {
      green2' = true;
      red2' = false;
    }
  }
}

module main {
  var A : boolean; // Action A
  var B : boolean; // Action B

  instance t1 : traffic_light1(green1, red1);
  instance t2 : traffic_light2(green2, red2);

  init {
    A = false;
    B = false;
  }

  next {
    havoc A;
    havoc B;

    if (A && t1.state == traffic_light1.state_t.RED && t2.state == traffic_light2.state_t.GREEN) {
      t1.state' = traffic_light1.state_t.GREEN;
      t2.state' = traffic_light2.state_t.RED;
    }

    if (B && t1.state == traffic_light1.state_t.GREEN && t2.state == traffic_light2.state_t.RED) {
      t1.state' = traffic_light1.state_t.RED;
      t2.state' = traffic_light2.state_t.GREEN;
    }
  }

  invariant no_deadlock : !(t1.state == traffic_light1.state_t.RED && t2.state == traffic_light2.state_t.GREEN && A && !B);

  control {
    check;
    print_results;
  }
}
```

This code models the behavior of two traffic lights at an intersection and checks for the possibility of deadlock. The traffic lights synchronize using actions A and B to transition between red and green states. The `main` module orchestrates the parallel composition of the two traffic lights and checks for the condition where one traffic light is red and the other is green with action A being enabled but not action B, which would indicate a potential deadlock scenario.
