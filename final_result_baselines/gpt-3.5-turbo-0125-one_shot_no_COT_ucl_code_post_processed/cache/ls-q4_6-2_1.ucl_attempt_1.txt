system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model the following feature for an automobile:

Once the engine is started, a beeper is sounded and a red light warning is indicated if there are passengers that have not buckled their seat belt. The beeper stops sounding after 30 seconds, or as soon the seat belts are buckled, whichever is sooner. The warning light is on all the time the seat belt is un-buckled. Hint: Assume the sensors provide a warn event when the ignition is turned on and there is a seat with passenger not buckled in, or if the ignition is already on and a passenger sits in a seat without buckling the seatbelt. Assume further that the sensors provide a noWarn event when a passenger departs from a seat, or when the buckle is buckled, or when the ignition is turned off.

Use the variable names warn, nowarn, time, ignitian and bucked.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Below is the Uclid5 code that models the described feature for an automobile:

```c
module automobile
{
    const BEEP_DURATION : int = 30;

    type ignition_t = enum { OFF, ON };
    type passenger_t = enum { NO, YES };
    type buckle_t = enum { BUCKLED, UNBUCKLED };
    type event_t = enum { WARN, NO_WARN };

    var ignition : ignition_t;
    var passenger : array[1] of passenger_t;
    var buckle : array[1] of buckle_t;
    var warn : boolean;
    var nowarn : boolean;
    var time : int;

    init {
        ignition = OFF;
        warn = false;
        nowarn = true;
        time = 0;
        forall (i := 1, i <= 1, i := i + 1) {
            passenger[i] = NO;
            buckle[i] = BUCKLED;
        }
    }

    event ignition_on = (ignition == OFF) && (forall (i := 1, i <= 1, i := i + 1) passenger[i] == YES && buckle[i] == UNBUCKLED);
    event ignition_off = (ignition == ON);

    event buckle_unbuckled = (forall (i := 1, i <= 1, i := i + 1) passenger[i] == YES && buckle[i] == UNBUCKLED);
    event buckle_buckled = (forall (i := 1, i <= 1, i := i + 1) passenger[i] == YES && buckle[i] == BUCKLED);

    event passenger_departed = (exists (i := 1, i <= 1, i := i + 1) passenger[i] == NO);

    next {
        if (ignition_on) {
            ignition := ON;
            warn := true;
            nowarn := false;
            time := 0;
        }

        if (ignition_off) {
            ignition := OFF;
            warn := false;
            nowarn := true;
            time := 0;
        }

        if (buckle_unbuckled) {
            warn := true;
            nowarn := false;
            time := 0;
        }

        if (buckle_buckled) {
            warn := false;
            nowarn := true;
            time := 0;
        }

        if (passenger_departed) {
            warn := false;
            nowarn := true;
            time := 0;
        }

        if (time < BEEP_DURATION) {
            time := time + 1;
        } else {
            warn := false;
            nowarn := true;
        }
    }
}
```

This code models the behavior of an automobile system where the warning beeper sounds and the red light warning is indicated based on the status of the ignition, passenger presence, and seat belt buckling. The system tracks the ignition state, passenger presence, seat belt buckling status, warning state, no warning state, and time elapsed.
