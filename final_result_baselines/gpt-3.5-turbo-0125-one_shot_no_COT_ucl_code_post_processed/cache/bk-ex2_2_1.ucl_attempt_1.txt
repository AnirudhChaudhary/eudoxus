system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Model a preliminary design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda.

The state space is S = { pay , select , soda , beer }. The set of initial states consists of only one state, i.e., I = { pay }. The (user) action insert coin denotes the insertion of a coin, while the (machine) actions get soda and get beer denote the delivery of soda and beer, respectively.

Use the variable names pay, select, soda and beer.

Write an LTL property that checks that the vending machine only delivers a drink after being provided with a coin. You may introduce auxiliary variables to do this if you need to.

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code that models the preliminary design of the beverage vending machine and includes an LTL property to check that a drink is only delivered after a coin is inserted:

```java
module vendingMachine {
  type state_t = enum { pay, select, soda, beer };
  var state : state_t;

  init {
    state = pay;
  }

  transition {
    // Inserting a coin transitions the machine from the pay state to the select state
    state == pay && insert_coin -> state' = select;

    // Selecting soda transitions the machine from the select state to the soda state
    state == select && get_soda -> state' = soda;

    // Selecting beer transitions the machine from the select state to the beer state
    state == select && get_beer -> state' = beer;
  }
}

module main {
  var insert_coin : boolean;
  var get_soda : boolean;
  var get_beer : boolean;

  // Instantiate the vending machine module
  instance vm : vendingMachine;

  // LTL property to check that a drink is only delivered after a coin is inserted
  property drink_after_coin {
    always {
      (vm.state == soda || vm.state == beer) -> (vm.state == select);
    }
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `vendingMachine` module models the state transitions of the vending machine, including the insertion of a coin and the delivery of soda and beer. The `main` module instantiates the `vendingMachine` module and defines an LTL property `drink_after_coin` that ensures that a drink is only delivered after a coin is inserted.
