system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Consider a system essentially consisting of a sender S and a receiver R that communicate with each other over channels c and d. The receiver sends messages to the sender via channel d, and the sender sends messages to the receiver via channel c.

It is assumed that both channels have an unlimited buffer.
Channel c is unreliable in the sense that data may get lost when being transmitted from the sender S to channel c. Once messages are stored in the buffer of channel c, they are neither corrupted nor lost. Channel d is assumed to be perfect.
The goal is to design a communication protocol that ensures any distinct transmitted datum by S to be delivered to R.
To ensure this in the presence of possible message losses, sender S resorts to retransmissions.

Messages are transmitted one by one, i.e., S starts sending a new message once the transmission of the previous message has been successful. This is a simple flow control principle, known as "send-and-wait".

Each message m from S is sent with a control bit b, and when R receives this, it sends an acknowledgement consisting of the control bit it just received. On receipt of the acknowledgement, S sends a new message with the negation of the control bit.  If S has to wait too long for the acknowledgement, it times out and retransmits the original message and control bit.

Build a model of this system, using submodules for S and R.

Use the variable names c, d, S, R, m and b

====================
assistant :: Certainly! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling the described system:

```c
module channel {
    var data : int;
    var ack : int;

    init {
        data = 0;
        ack = 0;
    }

    procedure send(d : int)
        modifies data;
    {
        data' = d;
    }

    procedure receive()
        modifies ack;
    {
        ack' = data;
    }
}

module sender {
    var m : int;
    var b : int;

    init {
        m = 0;
        b = 0;
    }

    procedure send_message()
        modifies m, b;
    {
        call channel.send(m);
        call channel.receive();
        if (channel.ack == b) {
            b' = !b;
        }
    }

    procedure retransmit_message()
        modifies m, b;
    {
        call channel.send(m);
        call channel.receive();
        if (channel.ack == b) {
            b' = !b;
        }
    }

    procedure timeout_retransmit()
        modifies m, b;
    {
        call retransmit_message();
    }
}

module receiver {
    var m : int;
    var b : int;

    init {
        m = 0;
        b = 0;
    }

    procedure receive_message()
        modifies m, b;
    {
        call channel.receive();
        call channel.send(b);
        b' = channel.data;
    }
}

module main {
    var c : channel;
    var d : channel;
    var S : sender;
    var R : receiver;

    init {
        assume(true); // Initial assumption placeholder
    }

    next {
        call S.send_message();
        call R.receive_message();
        if (c.data == S.m && d.data == R.m) {
            assume(true); // Placeholder for successful transmission
        } else {
            call S.timeout_retransmit();
            call R.receive_message();
            if (c.data == S.m && d.data == R.m) {
                assume(true); // Placeholder for successful retransmission
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This model captures the interaction between the sender `S` and receiver `R` over channels `c` and `d`. The sender sends messages with control bits to the receiver, which acknowledges the receipt and responds accordingly. In case of message loss or timeout, the sender retransmits the message.
