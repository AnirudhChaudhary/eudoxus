system :: You are an expert in program verification (hoare logic style). You are an expert user of UCLID5 which is a state transition modeling language. You will be given a description of a task and asked to write code.
====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:

  This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

====================
user :: Please write code in Uclid5 to model the following description:
  Let C1 be a circuit without input variables and with output variable y1 and register r1.
The control function for the output variable transition is y1'=r1, i.e., on the next step y1 is equal to the value of r1 from the previous step. The control function for the register variable transition is r1' = !r1.

Circuit C2 has input variable x2, output variable y2, and register variable r2 with the
control functions:
y2'= x2' OR r2
r2'=x2' OR r2

Model the synchronous composition of these two circuits.

Use the variable names y1, r1, x2, y2, and r2

====================
assistant :: Sure! Here is the Uclid5 code modeling the synchronous composition of the two circuits C1 and C2:

```c
module C1
{
  var r1 : boolean;
  output y1 : boolean;

  next {
    y1' = r1;
    r1' = !r1;
  }
}

module C2
{
  input x2 : boolean;
  var r2 : boolean;
  output y2 : boolean;

  next {
    y2' = x2 | r2;
    r2' = x2 | r2;
  }
}

module Composition
{
  var y1, y2 : boolean;
  var r1, r2 : boolean;
  var x2 : boolean;

  instance c1 : C1(y1, r1);
  instance c2 : C2(x2, y2, r2);

  init {
    r1 = nondet();
    r2 = nondet();
    x2 = nondet();
  }

  next {
    next(c1);
    next(c2);
  }
}
```

In this code, the `C1` module represents the first circuit with output variable `y1` and register `r1`. The control functions for `y1` and `r1` are defined as specified.

The `C2` module represents the second circuit with input variable `x2`, output variable `y2`, and register `r2`. The control functions for `y2` and `r2` are defined as specified.

The `Composition` module synchronously composes the two circuits `C1` and `C2` by instantiating instances of `C1` and `C2` and connecting their variables. The initial values are set using `nondet()` to represent non-deterministic values. The `next` block updates the states of both circuits in each step.
