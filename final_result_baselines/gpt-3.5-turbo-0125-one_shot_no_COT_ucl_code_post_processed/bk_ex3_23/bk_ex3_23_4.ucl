module traffic_light {
    type phase_t = enum { RED, GREEN, YELLOW };

    var red, green, yellow : phase_t;

    init {
        red = RED;
        green = GREEN;
        yellow = YELLOW;
    }

    next {
        if (red == RED) {
            assert yellow == YELLOW; // Safety property: Every red phase is immediately preceded by a yellow phase
        }
    }
}


In this model, the traffic light has three phases represented by the variables red, green, and yellow. The `init` block initializes the traffic light with red set to RED, green set to GREEN, and yellow set to YELLOW. The `next` block contains an assertion that checks the safety property that every red phase is immediately preceded by a yellow phase.
