In this code, we model the traffic light with three phases: RED, GREEN, and YELLOW. We initialize the traffic light with the phases in a specific order. The `next` block defines the state transitions for the traffic light, ensuring that the safety property is checked for every red phase being immediately preceded by a yellow phase.
