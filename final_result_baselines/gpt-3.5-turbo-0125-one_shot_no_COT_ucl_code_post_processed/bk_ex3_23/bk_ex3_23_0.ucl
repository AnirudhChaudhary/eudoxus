        if (green == GREEN) {
            // Add any specific transitions for the green phase here
        }

In this code snippet, we define a module `traffic_light` that models a traffic light with three phases: `RED`, `GREEN`, and `YELLOW`. The `init` block initializes the traffic light with the phases set to their initial values. The `next` block contains the logic for transitioning between phases, and an assertion is added to check the safety property that every `RED` phase is immediately preceded by a `YELLOW` phase.

You can further expand the transitions and add more complex behavior as needed for your traffic light model.
