    }

    invariant x_between_0_and_200 {
        x >= 0 && x <= 200;
    }
}


In this model, the processes Inc, Dec, and Reset continuously operate on the shared variable x according to the specified rules. The invariant `x_between_0_and_200` ensures that the value of x remains between 0 and 200, inclusive, at all times.
