In this code, the `C1` module represents the first circuit with output variable `y1` and register `r1`. The control functions for `y1` and `r1` are defined as specified.

The `C2` module represents the second circuit with input variable `x2`, output variable `y2`, and register `r2`. The control functions for `y2` and `r2` are defined as specified.

The `Composition` module synchronously composes the two circuits `C1` and `C2` by instantiating instances of `C1` and `C2` and connecting their variables. The initial values are set using `nondet()` to represent non-deterministic values. The `next` block updates the states of both circuits in each step.
