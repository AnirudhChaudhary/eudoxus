This model defines a leader election protocol for n processes in a ring topology. Each process sends its unique identifier (id) through the channel and then enters a loop where it receives messages from its neighbor. If the received message is the process's own id, it stops. If the received message has a higher id, it forwards the message. The processes are created and initialized in the `init` block.
