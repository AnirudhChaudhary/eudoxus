    // Selecting soda transitions the machine from the select state to the soda state
    state == select && get_soda -> state' = soda;

    // Selecting beer transitions the machine from the select state to the beer state
    state == select && get_beer -> state' = beer;

module main {
  var insert_coin : boolean;
  var get_soda : boolean;
  var get_beer : boolean;

  // Instantiate the vending machine module
  instance vm : vendingMachine;

  // LTL property to check that a drink is only delivered after a coin is inserted

    }
  }
}


In this code snippet, the `vendingMachine` module models the state transitions of the vending machine, including the insertion of a coin and the delivery of soda and beer. The `main` module instantiates the `vendingMachine` module and defines an LTL property `drink_after_coin` that ensures that a drink is only delivered after a coin is inserted.
