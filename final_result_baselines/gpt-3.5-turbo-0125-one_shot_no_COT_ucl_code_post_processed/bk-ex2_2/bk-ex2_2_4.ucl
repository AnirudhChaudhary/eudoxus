In this code, the vending machine has states `pay`, `select`, `soda`, and `beer`. The `coin_inserted` variable tracks whether a coin has been inserted. The `insertCoin`, `getSoda`, and `getBeer` processes model the actions of inserting a coin, getting soda, and getting beer, respectively.

The LTL property `drink_after_coin` checks that a drink (soda or beer) is only delivered after a coin has been inserted. The property states that whenever the vending machine is in the `soda` or `beer` state, the `coin_inserted` variable must be true.
