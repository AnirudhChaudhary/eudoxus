In this model, the `light_on` variable represents the state of the dome light, `door_open` indicates if any door is open, and `time` keeps track of how long the dome light has been on since the last door closure. The `transition` block defines the behavior of the dome light based on the state of the doors and the elapsed time. The `system` block allows for nondeterministic input for the `door_open` variable to simulate the opening and closing of doors.
