This code models the interactions between the bar code reader (BCR), the booking program (BP), and the printer in the described booking system. The states of each process are represented by the variables `BCR_state`, `BP_state`, and `Printer_state`. The transitions between states are defined based on the described behavior of each process. The `main` module orchestrates the interactions between instances of the BCR, BP, and Printer processes.
