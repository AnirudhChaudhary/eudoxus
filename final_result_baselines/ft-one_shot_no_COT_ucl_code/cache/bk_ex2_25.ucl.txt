system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:

This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Consider the processes P1 and P2 with the shared variables b1, b2, and x.
b1 and b2 are Boolean variables, while x can take either the value 1 or 2, i.e., dom(x) = {1,2}. The scheduling strategy is realized using x as follows. If both processes want to enter the critical section (i.e., they are in location waiti), the value of variable x decides which of the two processes may enter its critical section: if x = i, then Pi may enter its critical section (for i = 1, 2). On entering location wait1, process P1 performs x := 2, thus giving privilege to process P2 to enter the critical section. The value of x thus indicates which process has its turn to enter the critical section. Symmetrically, P2 sets x to 1 when starting to wait. The variables bi provide information about the current location of Pi.

More precisely,

bi =waiti OR criti.

bi is set when Pi starts to wait. In pseudocode, P1 performs as follows (the code for process P2 is similar):

loop forever
.
.
.
⟨b1 := true; x := 2⟩;
wait until (x = 1 ∨ ¬b2)
do critical section od
b1 := false
.
.
.
end loop

Build a transition system that models the interleaving of P1 and P2.

Use the variable names b1, b2 and x.

====================
assistant :: module main {
    type pc_t = enum { wait1, crit1, wait2, crit2 };
    var x : 1..2;
    var b1, b2 : boolean;

    procedure P1()
    {
        loop {
            b1 = true;
            x = 2;
            wait (x == 1 || !b2);
            do crit1;
            b1 = false;
        }
    }

    procedure P2()
    {
        loop {
            b2 = true;
            x = 1;
            wait (x == 2 || !b1);
            do crit2;
            b2 = false;
        }
    }

    init {
        b1 = false;
        b2 = false;
        x = 1;
    }

    next {
        P1();
        P2();
    }
}
