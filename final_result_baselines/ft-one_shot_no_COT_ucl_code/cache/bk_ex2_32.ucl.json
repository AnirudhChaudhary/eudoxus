It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "module process1\n{\n  type pc_t = enum { A };\n\n  var pc : pc_t;\n  input s : boolean; // secret input\n  input x : boolean; // public input\n  output z: boolean; // public output\n\n  init {\n    pc = A;\n    z = false;\n  }\n\n  next {\n    z' = !x;\n  }\n\n}\n\nmodule process2\n{\n  type pc_t = enum { B, C };\n\n  var pc : pc_t;\n  input s : boolean; // secret input\n  input x : boolean; // public input\n  output z: boolean; // public output\n\n  procedure next_state()\n    modifies z;\n    modifies pc;\n  {\n    case\n      (pc == B) && s && !x : { pc = C; z = true; }\n      (pc == C) && s && !x : { pc = B; z = false; }\n    esac\n  }\n\n  init {\n    pc = B;\n    z = false;\n  }\n\n  next {\n    call next_state();\n  }\n}\n\n\nmodule main\n{\n  type t1pc_t = process1.pc_t;\n  type t2pc_t = process2.pc_t;\n\n  var x1,x2 : boolean;\n  var s1,s2 : boolean;\n  var z1,z2 : boolean;\n\n/*\n  instance p11 : process1(z: (z1), s : (s1), x : (x1));\n  instance p12 : process1(z: (z2), s : (s2), x : (x2));\n*/\n\n/* \n*/\n  instance p21 : process2(z: (z1), s : (s1), x : (x1));\n  instance p22 : process2(z: (z2), s : (s2), x : (x2));\n\n  init {\n    havoc x1; havoc x2; \n    havoc s1; havoc s2; \n    assume(x1 == x2);\n  }\n\n  next {\n    havoc x1; havoc x2; \n    havoc s1; havoc s2; \n    assume(x1' == x2');\n    // next(p11); next(p12);\n    next(p21); next(p22);\n  }\n\n  invariant same_output_z : (z1 == z2);\n\n\n  control {\n    // *** BASIC ASSERTIONS/INVARIANT\n/*\n*/\n    v = unroll(5);\n    check;\n    print_results;\n    //v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p11.pc,p12.pc);\n    v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p21.pc,p22.pc);\n\n/*\n    // *** INDUCTION\n    v = induction(1); \n    check;\n    print_results;\n    v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p11.pc,p12.pc);\n*/\n  }\n}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a uclid5 model for the following description: \nConsider a system essentially consisting of a sender S and a receiver R that communicate with each other over channels c and d. The receiver sends messages to the sender via channel d, and the sender sends messages to the receiver via channel c.\n\nIt is assumed that both channels have an unlimited buffer.\nChannel c is unreliable in the sense that data may get lost when being transmitted from the sender S to channel c. Once messages are stored in the buffer of channel c, they are neither corrupted nor lost. Channel d is assumed to be perfect.\nThe goal is to design a communication protocol that ensures any distinct transmitted datum by S to be delivered to R.\nTo ensure this in the presence of possible message losses, sender S resorts to retransmissions.\n\nMessages are transmitted one by one, i.e., S starts sending a new message once the transmission of the previous message has been successful. This is a simple flow control principle, known as \"send-and-wait\".\n\nEach message m from S is sent with a control bit b, and when R receives this, it sends an acknowledgement consisting of the control bit it just received. On receipt of the acknowledgement, S sends a new message with the negation of the control bit.  If S has to wait too long for the acknowledgement, it times out and retransmits the original message and control bit.\n\nBuild a model of this system, using submodules for S and R.\n\nUse the variable names c, d, S, R, m and b\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\nmodule S\n{\n    input c : boolean;\n    input d : boolean;\n    output m : boolean;\n    output b : boolean;\n    \n    var timeout : boolean;\n    \n    init {\n        timeout := false;\n    }\n    \n    next {\n        if timeout then\n            m' = m;\n            b' = b;\n            timeout' = false;\n        else\n            m' = !m;\n            b' = b;\n            timeout' = true;\n        endif\n    }\n}\n\nmodule R\n{\n    input c : boolean;\n    input d : boolean;\n    input m : boolean;\n    input b : boolean;\n    \n    output c : boolean;\n    output d : boolean;\n    \n    init {}\n    \n    next {\n        c' = c;\n        d' = m;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule main\n{\n    instance s : S(c, d, m, b);\n    instance r : R(c, d, m, b);\n    \n    init {}\n    \n    next {\n        next(s);\n        next(r);\n    }\n}\n```"}]
