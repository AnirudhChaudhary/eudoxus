           â”‚ Here, we assert that it's globally true that not all philosophers are simultaneously waiting to eat while holding their respective chopsticks. This   â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL specification ensures that the system is deadlock-free; a deadlock in the context would mean all philosophers are holding one chopstick and       â”‚            
           â”‚ waiting indefinitely for another, something which this formula prohibits. 2. **Starvation Freedom (Liveness)**:  [  \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\},  â”‚            
           â”‚ G (F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is thinking}) \to F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is eating}))  \]  **Explanation:**  This states that if a philosopher ever       â”‚            
           â”‚ begins thinking, then it is eventually guaranteed that they will eat. This specification aims to assure fairness and prevent starvation where a       â”‚            
           â”‚ philosopher could indefinitely wait to eat. 3. **Eventually Eating**:  [  \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, G (F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is eating}))    â”‚            
           â”‚ \]  **Explanation:**  This LTL property assures that each philosopher must eventually get a chance to eat, reinforcing the system's requirement for   â”‚            
           â”‚ minimal guarantees of access to the shared resource (rice). The provided invariants and LTL specifications establish basic requirements for ensuring  â”‚

           â”‚ \text{phil}_{(i \mod 5) + 1} \text{ are eating simultaneously})  \]  **Explanation:**  This invariant ensures that neighboring philosophers cannot    â”‚            
           â”‚ eat at the same time since they need to share a chopstick. This guarantees the mutual exclusion property on chopsticks. 2. **Chopstick Possession     â”‚            
           â”‚ Requirement for Eating**:  [  \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, (\text{phil}_i \text{ is eating}) \to (\text{chopstick}_i \wedge \text{chopstick}_{(i  â”‚            
           â”‚ \mod 5) + 1})  \]  **Explanation:**  This ensures that a philosopher can eat if and only if they hold both their designated chopstick and the one to  â”‚

           â”‚ Here, we assert that it's globally true that not all philosophers are simultaneously waiting to eat while holding their respective chopsticks. This   â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL specification ensures that the system is deadlock-free; a deadlock in the context would mean all philosophers are holding one chopstick and       â”‚            
           â”‚ waiting indefinitely for another, something which this formula prohibits. 2. **Starvation Freedom (Liveness)**:  [  \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\},  â”‚            
           â”‚ G (F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is thinking}) \to F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is eating}))  \]  **Explanation:**  This states that if a philosopher ever       â”‚            
           â”‚ begins thinking, then it is eventually guaranteed that they will eat. This specification aims to assure fairness and prevent starvation where a       â”‚            
           â”‚ philosopher could indefinitely wait to eat. 3. **Eventually Eating**:  [  \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, G (F (\text{phil}_i \text{ is eating}))    â”‚            
           â”‚ \]  **Explanation:**  This LTL property assures that each philosopher must eventually get a chance to eat, reinforcing the system's requirement for   â”‚
