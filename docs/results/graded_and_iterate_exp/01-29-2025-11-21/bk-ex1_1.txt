           â”‚ The primary invariant that can be identified from the description is the range within which the variable x must reside. Given the operations          â”‚            
           â”‚ performed by the processes on x, it should never go below 0 or above 200. Here's the formalization of this invariant: **Invariant I1:**  [ 0 \leq x   â”‚            
           â”‚ \leq 200 \] #### Explanation: - **I1:** Each operation defined in the processes (Inc, Dec, Reset) manipulates x without allowing it to exceed the     â”‚            
           â”‚ bounds of 0 and 200. Inc increments x only if it is less than 200, keeping x within the upper bound. Dec decrements x only if it is greater than 0,   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring x stays above the lower bound. Reset turns x to 0 when it reaches exactly 200, which directly confines x to the defined range. Hence, x      â”‚            
           â”‚ always remains between 0 and 200 inclusive. ### LTL Specifications Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is used to express temporal behaviors in the system.   â”‚            
           â”‚ For this setup, we can specify properties related to the system behavior over time pertaining to safety and eventual consistency. **LTL Specification â”‚            
           â”‚ S1:**  [ G (x < 200 \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S2:**  [ G (x = 200 \rightarrow X(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S3:**  [ G (x > 0   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] #### Explanations: - **S1:** Globally, if x is less than 200, it is eventually set to 0. This specification interprets how   â”‚            
           â”‚ the system should behave in ensuring that x returns to 0 after not reaching the upper threshold, influenced primarily by the actions of Reset after   â”‚            
           â”‚ reaching this limit, indirectly ensuring Reset continuously performs as expected. - **S2:** Globally, if x equals 200 at any state, in the next state â”‚            
           â”‚ x must be reset to 0. This directly reflects the behavior of the Reset process and ensures it acts precisely when x reaches 200. - **S3:** Globally,  â”‚            
           â”‚ if x is greater than 0, it should eventually be possible for x to be 0. This property is a reflection of the systemâ€™s capability to eventually        â”‚            
           â”‚ decrease x to 0 through a series of Dec operations or a direct Reset, promoting the concept of eventual consistency where the system should not       â”‚            
           â”‚ remain indefinitely in a non-zero state unless perpetually incremented before reaching 200 which would be intercepted by the Reset operation.  These  â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL properties ensure a robust definition of the system's temporal behavior, covering various state transitions and interactions among the processes, â”‚

           â”‚ 1. **Incrementing x:** The model correctly ensures that `x` is incremented only if it is less than 200, thus not allowing it to surpass 200.          â”‚            
           â”‚ 2. **Decrementing x:** The model correctly allows `x` to decrement only if it is greater than 0, preventing `x` from going negative.                  â”‚

           â”‚ The primary invariant that can be identified from the description is the range within which the variable x must reside. Given the operations          â”‚            
           â”‚ performed by the processes on x, it should never go below 0 or above 200. Here's the formalization of this invariant: **Invariant I1:**  [ 0 \leq x   â”‚            
           â”‚ \leq 200 \] #### Explanation: - **I1:** Each operation defined in the processes (Inc, Dec, Reset) manipulates x without allowing it to exceed the     â”‚            
           â”‚ bounds of 0 and 200. Inc increments x only if it is less than 200, keeping x within the upper bound. Dec decrements x only if it is greater than 0,   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring x stays above the lower bound. Reset turns x to 0 when it reaches exactly 200, which directly confines x to the defined range. Hence, x      â”‚            
           â”‚ always remains between 0 and 200 inclusive. ### LTL Specifications Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is used to express temporal behaviors in the system.   â”‚            
           â”‚ For this setup, we can specify properties related to the system behavior over time pertaining to safety and eventual consistency. **LTL Specification â”‚            
           â”‚ S1:**  [ G (x < 200 \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S2:**  [ G (x = 200 \rightarrow X(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S3:**  [ G (x > 0   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] #### Explanations: - **S1:** Globally, if x is less than 200, it is eventually set to 0. This specification interprets how   â”‚            
           â”‚ the system should behave in ensuring that x returns to 0 after not reaching the upper threshold, influenced primarily by the actions of Reset after   â”‚            
           â”‚ reaching this limit, indirectly ensuring Reset continuously performs as expected. - **S2:** Globally, if x equals 200 at any state, in the next state â”‚            
           â”‚ x must be reset to 0. This directly reflects the behavior of the Reset process and ensures it acts precisely when x reaches 200. - **S3:** Globally,  â”‚            
           â”‚ if x is greater than 0, it should eventually be possible for x to be 0. This property is a reflection of the systemâ€™s capability to eventually        â”‚            
           â”‚ decrease x to 0 through a series of Dec operations or a direct Reset, promoting the concept of eventual consistency where the system should not       â”‚            
           â”‚ remain indefinitely in a non-zero state unless perpetually incremented before reaching 200 which would be intercepted by the Reset operation.  These  â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL properties ensure a robust definition of the system's temporal behavior, covering various state transitions and interactions among the processes, â”‚

           â”‚ > ### Invariants To ensure the system operates correctly according to its description, we need to identify the conditions that must always be true.   â”‚            
           â”‚ The primary invariant that can be identified from the description is the range within which the variable x must reside. Given the operations          â”‚            
           â”‚ performed by the processes on x, it should never go below 0 or above 200. Here's the formalization of this invariant: **Invariant I1:**  [ 0 \leq x   â”‚            
           â”‚ \leq 200 \] #### Explanation: - **I1:** Each operation defined in the processes (Inc, Dec, Reset) manipulates x without allowing it to exceed the     â”‚            
           â”‚ bounds of 0 and 200. Inc increments x only if it is less than 200, keeping x within the upper bound. Dec decrements x only if it is greater than 0,   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring x stays above the lower bound. Reset turns x to 0 when it reaches exactly 200, which directly confines x to the defined range. Hence, x      â”‚            
           â”‚ always remains between 0 and 200 inclusive. ### LTL Specifications Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is used to express temporal behaviors in the system.   â”‚            
           â”‚ For this setup, we can specify properties related to the system behavior over time pertaining to safety and eventual consistency. **LTL Specification â”‚            
           â”‚ S1:**  [ G (x < 200 \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S2:**  [ G (x = 200 \rightarrow X(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S3:**  [ G (x > 0   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] #### Explanations: - **S1:** Globally, if x is less than 200, it is eventually set to 0. This specification interprets how   â”‚            
           â”‚ the system should behave in ensuring that x returns to 0 after not reaching the upper threshold, influenced primarily by the actions of Reset after   â”‚            
           â”‚ reaching this limit, indirectly ensuring Reset continuously performs as expected. - **S2:** Globally, if x equals 200 at any state, in the next state â”‚            
           â”‚ x must be reset to 0. This directly reflects the behavior of the Reset process and ensures it acts precisely when x reaches 200. - **S3:** Globally,  â”‚            
           â”‚ if x is greater than 0, it should eventually be possible for x to be 0. This property is a reflection of the systemâ€™s capability to eventually        â”‚            
           â”‚ decrease x to 0 through a series of Dec operations or a direct Reset, promoting the concept of eventual consistency where the system should not       â”‚            
           â”‚ remain indefinitely in a non-zero state unless perpetually incremented before reaching 200 which would be intercepted by the Reset operation.  These  â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL properties ensure a robust definition of the system's temporal behavior, covering various state transitions and interactions among the processes, â”‚

           â”‚ > ### Invariants To ensure the system operates correctly according to its description, we need to identify the conditions that must always be true.   â”‚            
           â”‚ The primary invariant that can be identified from the description is the range within which the variable x must reside. Given the operations          â”‚            
           â”‚ performed by the processes on x, it should never go below 0 or above 200. Here's the formalization of this invariant: **Invariant I1:**  [ 0 \leq x   â”‚            
           â”‚ \leq 200 \] #### Explanation: - **I1:** Each operation defined in the processes (Inc, Dec, Reset) manipulates x without allowing it to exceed the     â”‚            
           â”‚ bounds of 0 and 200. Inc increments x only if it is less than 200, keeping x within the upper bound. Dec decrements x only if it is greater than 0,   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring x stays above the lower bound. Reset turns x to 0 when it reaches exactly 200, which directly confines x to the defined range. Hence, x      â”‚            
           â”‚ always remains between 0 and 200 inclusive. ### LTL Specifications Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is used to express temporal behaviors in the system.   â”‚            
           â”‚ For this setup, we can specify properties related to the system behavior over time pertaining to safety and eventual consistency. **LTL Specification â”‚            
           â”‚ S1:**  [ G (x < 200 \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S2:**  [ G (x = 200 \rightarrow X(x = 0)) \] **LTL Specification S3:**  [ G (x > 0   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F(x = 0)) \] #### Explanations: - **S1:** Globally, if x is less than 200, it is eventually set to 0. This specification interprets how   â”‚            
           â”‚ the system should behave in ensuring that x returns to 0 after not reaching the upper threshold, influenced primarily by the actions of Reset after   â”‚            
           â”‚ reaching this limit, indirectly ensuring Reset continuously performs as expected. - **S2:** Globally, if x equals 200 at any state, in the next state â”‚            
           â”‚ x must be reset to 0. This directly reflects the behavior of the Reset process and ensures it acts precisely when x reaches 200. - **S3:** Globally,  â”‚            
           â”‚ if x is greater than 0, it should eventually be possible for x to be 0. This property is a reflection of the systemâ€™s capability to eventually        â”‚            
           â”‚ decrease x to 0 through a series of Dec operations or a direct Reset, promoting the concept of eventual consistency where the system should not       â”‚            
           â”‚ remain indefinitely in a non-zero state unless perpetually incremented before reaching 200 which would be intercepted by the Reset operation.  These  â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL properties ensure a robust definition of the system's temporal behavior, covering various state transitions and interactions among the processes, â”‚
