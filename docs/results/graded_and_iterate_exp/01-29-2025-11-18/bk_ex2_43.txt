           â”‚ > Modeling the synchronous composition of the two circuits C1 and C2 involves considering the outputs and register transitions for both circuits      â”‚            
           â”‚ operating simultaneously under shared time steps. Since inputs, outputs, and registers need to be evaluated and transitioned at each clock tick, it's â”‚            
           â”‚ crucial to preserve the consistency of their behavior across all states and time. ### Invariants 1. **Invariant 1 (Consistency of `r1` with `y1`):**  â”‚            
           â”‚ [ y1 = r1 \]  - Explanation: Given `y1' = r1`, `y1` will always equal `r1` at every step after initialization, because `y1` directly follows `r1` as  â”‚            
           â”‚ `r1` changes. 2. **Invariant 2 (Alternating States of `r1` and Therefore `y1`):**  [ r1 \neq r1' \]  - Explanation: Since `r1' = !r1`, `r1` will      â”‚            
           â”‚ always be the negation of its previous state, capturing the toggle behavior. 3. **Invariant 3 (Relation between `r2` and `x2`):**  [ r2 = x2 \text{   â”‚            
           â”‚ OR } r2 \]  - Explanation: As per the control function `r2' = x2' OR r2`, it can be inferred that once `r2` becomes true, it always remains true      â”‚            
           â”‚ (until possibly reset if the system supports it). This behavior is persistent due to the nature of OR operation with itself. 4. **Invariant 4 (Output â”‚            
           â”‚ `y2` is determined by `x2` and `r2`):**  [ y2 = r2 \]  - Explanation: Following similar reasoning to invariant 3 and `y2' = x2' OR r2`, `y2` will be  â”‚            
           â”‚ equivalent to `r2` given both `y2` and `r2` depend on similar conditions. ### LTL Specifications 1. **LTL Specification 1 (Stability of `r1` once     â”‚            
           â”‚ set):**  [ G(r1' = !r1) \]  - Explanation: Globally, at every step, `r1` will always change to the complement of its previous state. This LTL         â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures the circuit consistently flips `r1`. 2. **LTL Specification 2 (Persistence of `r2` once set):**  [ G(x2 \to G(r2)) \]  -        â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: If `x2` is ever true, `r2` will consequently be set to true and will remain true in all subsequent states (`r2` will persist true due to â”‚            
           â”‚ the OR operation with itself). 3. **LTL Specification 3 (Initial False State of `r2` and Transition to True):**  [ F(x2 \land \neg r2) \land G(x2 \to â”‚            
           â”‚ G(r2)) \]  - Explanation: This requirements reasonably expects that at some point, `x2` will be true while `r2` is false, and afterwards, once `x2`   â”‚            
           â”‚ has been set true, `r2` will always be true. 4. **LTL Specification 4 (Output `y2` follows the behavior of `r2`):**  [ G(y2 \leftrightarrow r2) \]  - â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Globally, for all states of the system, the output `y2` will mirror the value of `r2`, maintaining this direct correlation at all times. â”‚

           â”‚ operating simultaneously under shared time steps. Since inputs, outputs, and registers need to be evaluated and transitioned at each clock tick, it's â”‚            
           â”‚ crucial to preserve the consistency of their behavior across all states and time. ### Invariants 1. **Invariant 1 (Consistency of `r1` with `y1`):**  â”‚            
           â”‚ [ y1 = r1 \]  - Explanation: Given `y1' = r1`, `y1` will always equal `r1` at every step after initialization, because `y1` directly follows `r1` as  â”‚            
           â”‚ `r1` changes. 2. **Invariant 2 (Alternating States of `r1` and Therefore `y1`):**  [ r1 \neq r1' \]  - Explanation: Since `r1' = !r1`, `r1` will      â”‚            
           â”‚ always be the negation of its previous state, capturing the toggle behavior. 3. **Invariant 3 (Relation between `r2` and `x2`):**  [ r2 = x2 \text{   â”‚            
           â”‚ OR } r2 \]  - Explanation: As per the control function `r2' = x2' OR r2`, it can be inferred that once `r2` becomes true, it always remains true      â”‚            
           â”‚ (until possibly reset if the system supports it). This behavior is persistent due to the nature of OR operation with itself. 4. **Invariant 4 (Output â”‚            
           â”‚ `y2` is determined by `x2` and `r2`):**  [ y2 = r2 \]  - Explanation: Following similar reasoning to invariant 3 and `y2' = x2' OR r2`, `y2` will be  â”‚            
           â”‚ equivalent to `r2` given both `y2` and `r2` depend on similar conditions. ### LTL Specifications 1. **LTL Specification 1 (Stability of `r1` once     â”‚            
           â”‚ set):**  [ G(r1' = !r1) \]  - Explanation: Globally, at every step, `r1` will always change to the complement of its previous state. This LTL         â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures the circuit consistently flips `r1`. 2. **LTL Specification 2 (Persistence of `r2` once set):**  [ G(x2 \to G(r2)) \]  -        â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: If `x2` is ever true, `r2` will consequently be set to true and will remain true in all subsequent states (`r2` will persist true due to â”‚            
           â”‚ the OR operation with itself). 3. **LTL Specification 3 (Initial False State of `r2` and Transition to True):**  [ F(x2 \land \neg r2) \land G(x2 \to â”‚            
           â”‚ G(r2)) \]  - Explanation: This requirements reasonably expects that at some point, `x2` will be true while `r2` is false, and afterwards, once `x2`   â”‚            
           â”‚ has been set true, `r2` will always be true. 4. **LTL Specification 4 (Output `y2` follows the behavior of `r2`):**  [ G(y2 \leftrightarrow r2) \]  - â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Globally, for all states of the system, the output `y2` will mirror the value of `r2`, maintaining this direct correlation at all times. â”‚

           â”‚ operating simultaneously under shared time steps. Since inputs, outputs, and registers need to be evaluated and transitioned at each clock tick, it's â”‚            
           â”‚ crucial to preserve the consistency of their behavior across all states and time. ### Invariants 1. **Invariant 1 (Consistency of `r1` with `y1`):**  â”‚            
           â”‚ [ y1 = r1 \]  - Explanation: Given `y1' = r1`, `y1` will always equal `r1` at every step after initialization, because `y1` directly follows `r1` as  â”‚            
           â”‚ `r1` changes. 2. **Invariant 2 (Alternating States of `r1` and Therefore `y1`):**  [ r1 \neq r1' \]  - Explanation: Since `r1' = !r1`, `r1` will      â”‚            
           â”‚ always be the negation of its previous state, capturing the toggle behavior. 3. **Invariant 3 (Relation between `r2` and `x2`):**  [ r2 = x2 \text{   â”‚            
           â”‚ OR } r2 \]  - Explanation: As per the control function `r2' = x2' OR r2`, it can be inferred that once `r2` becomes true, it always remains true      â”‚            
           â”‚ (until possibly reset if the system supports it). This behavior is persistent due to the nature of OR operation with itself. 4. **Invariant 4 (Output â”‚            
           â”‚ `y2` is determined by `x2` and `r2`):**  [ y2 = r2 \]  - Explanation: Following similar reasoning to invariant 3 and `y2' = x2' OR r2`, `y2` will be  â”‚            
           â”‚ equivalent to `r2` given both `y2` and `r2` depend on similar conditions. ### LTL Specifications 1. **LTL Specification 1 (Stability of `r1` once     â”‚            
           â”‚ set):**  [ G(r1' = !r1) \]  - Explanation: Globally, at every step, `r1` will always change to the complement of its previous state. This LTL         â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures the circuit consistently flips `r1`. 2. **LTL Specification 2 (Persistence of `r2` once set):**  [ G(x2 \to G(r2)) \]  -        â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: If `x2` is ever true, `r2` will consequently be set to true and will remain true in all subsequent states (`r2` will persist true due to â”‚            
           â”‚ the OR operation with itself). 3. **LTL Specification 3 (Initial False State of `r2` and Transition to True):**  [ F(x2 \land \neg r2) \land G(x2 \to â”‚            
           â”‚ G(r2)) \]  - Explanation: This requirements reasonably expects that at some point, `x2` will be true while `r2` is false, and afterwards, once `x2`   â”‚            
           â”‚ has been set true, `r2` will always be true. 4. **LTL Specification 4 (Output `y2` follows the behavior of `r2`):**  [ G(y2 \leftrightarrow r2) \]  - â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Globally, for all states of the system, the output `y2` will mirror the value of `r2`, maintaining this direct correlation at all times. â”‚

           â”‚ operating simultaneously under shared time steps. Since inputs, outputs, and registers need to be evaluated and transitioned at each clock tick, it's â”‚            
           â”‚ crucial to preserve the consistency of their behavior across all states and time. ### Invariants 1. **Invariant 1 (Consistency of `r1` with `y1`):**  â”‚            
           â”‚ [ y1 = r1 \]  - Explanation: Given `y1' = r1`, `y1` will always equal `r1` at every step after initialization, because `y1` directly follows `r1` as  â”‚            
           â”‚ `r1` changes. 2. **Invariant 2 (Alternating States of `r1` and Therefore `y1`):**  [ r1 \neq r1' \]  - Explanation: Since `r1' = !r1`, `r1` will      â”‚            
           â”‚ always be the negation of its previous state, capturing the toggle behavior. 3. **Invariant 3 (Relation between `r2` and `x2`):**  [ r2 = x2 \text{   â”‚            
           â”‚ OR } r2 \]  - Explanation: As per the control function `r2' = x2' OR r2`, it can be inferred that once `r2` becomes true, it always remains true      â”‚            
           â”‚ (until possibly reset if the system supports it). This behavior is persistent due to the nature of OR operation with itself. 4. **Invariant 4 (Output â”‚            
           â”‚ `y2` is determined by `x2` and `r2`):**  [ y2 = r2 \]  - Explanation: Following similar reasoning to invariant 3 and `y2' = x2' OR r2`, `y2` will be  â”‚            
           â”‚ equivalent to `r2` given both `y2` and `r2` depend on similar conditions. ### LTL Specifications 1. **LTL Specification 1 (Stability of `r1` once     â”‚            
           â”‚ set):**  [ G(r1' = !r1) \]  - Explanation: Globally, at every step, `r1` will always change to the complement of its previous state. This LTL         â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures the circuit consistently flips `r1`. 2. **LTL Specification 2 (Persistence of `r2` once set):**  [ G(x2 \to G(r2)) \]  -        â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: If `x2` is ever true, `r2` will consequently be set to true and will remain true in all subsequent states (`r2` will persist true due to â”‚            
           â”‚ the OR operation with itself). 3. **LTL Specification 3 (Initial False State of `r2` and Transition to True):**  [ F(x2 \land \neg r2) \land G(x2 \to â”‚            
           â”‚ G(r2)) \]  - Explanation: This requirements reasonably expects that at some point, `x2` will be true while `r2` is false, and afterwards, once `x2`   â”‚            
           â”‚ has been set true, `r2` will always be true. 4. **LTL Specification 4 (Output `y2` follows the behavior of `r2`):**  [ G(y2 \leftrightarrow r2) \]  - â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Globally, for all states of the system, the output `y2` will mirror the value of `r2`, maintaining this direct correlation at all times. â”‚
