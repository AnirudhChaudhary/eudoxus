           â”‚ inside the garage cannot be negative; this invariant ensures that the counter value remains logical and realistic at all times. 2. **Counter          â”‚            
           â”‚ Limits**: If the maximum capacity of the garage is \( C \), then \( \text{counter} \leq C \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that the car   â”‚            
           â”‚ count does not exceed the total capacity of the garage, maintaining the physical constraints of the parking space.   3. **Count Consistency**: \(     â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{counter} = \text{arrivals} - \text{departures} + i \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures the accuracy of the count at all states,        â”‚            
           â”‚ reflecting an accurate number of cars in the garage relative to how many cars have entered and left since the beginning. ### LTL Specifications for   â”‚            
           â”‚ the Parking Garage Counter System 1. **Safety Requirement - Max Capacity Never Exceeded**:  [ G (\text{counter} \leq C) \]  **Explanation**:          â”‚            
           â”‚ Globally, it must always be true that the counter does not exceed the maximum capacity of the parking garage to ensure safety and compliance with     â”‚            
           â”‚ garage limits. 2. **Liveness Requirement - Every Arrival Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F                 â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: For every car that arrives (triggered by the `arrival` event), it should eventually lead to an output    â”‚            
           â”‚ event that updates the display. This ensures that the system remains live and responsive to changes. 3. **Liveness Requirement - Every Departure      â”‚            
           â”‚ Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow F (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: Similarly, for every car  â”‚            
           â”‚ that departs (indicated by a `departure` event), it must eventually trigger an output event that updates the display. This ensures the display is     â”‚            
           â”‚ accurate and the system systematically tracks departures. 4. **Fairness Requirement - If Cars Arrive, They Must Eventually Leave**:  [ G              â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F (\text{departure})) \]  **Explanation**: This specification asserts that if cars are continuously arriving, then under  â”‚            
           â”‚ normal operations, they should also eventually leave. This focuses on the operational dynamics where garages do not just fill up; but also have cars  â”‚            
           â”‚ exiting. 5. **Safety Requirement - The Counter Does Not Decrease at Arrival or Increase at Departure**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow X            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} + 1)) \]  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow X (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} - 1)) \]                  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: When a car arrives, in the following state, the counter should increase by exactly one. Conversely, when a car departs, in the next  â”‚            
           â”‚ state, the counter should decrease by exactly one. These specifications prevent erroneous updates to the counter and ensure its accurate reflection   â”‚            
           â”‚ of the number of cars. These properties and behaviors are key to ensuring that the system operates safely, efficiently, and effectively, aligning     â”‚            
           â”‚ with user expectations and physical constraints in the garage environment.                                                                            â”‚

           â”‚ inside the garage cannot be negative; this invariant ensures that the counter value remains logical and realistic at all times. 2. **Counter          â”‚            
           â”‚ Limits**: If the maximum capacity of the garage is \( C \), then \( \text{counter} \leq C \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that the car   â”‚            
           â”‚ count does not exceed the total capacity of the garage, maintaining the physical constraints of the parking space.   3. **Count Consistency**: \(     â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{counter} = \text{arrivals} - \text{departures} + i \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures the accuracy of the count at all states,        â”‚            
           â”‚ reflecting an accurate number of cars in the garage relative to how many cars have entered and left since the beginning. ### LTL Specifications for   â”‚            
           â”‚ the Parking Garage Counter System 1. **Safety Requirement - Max Capacity Never Exceeded**:  [ G (\text{counter} \leq C) \]  **Explanation**:          â”‚            
           â”‚ Globally, it must always be true that the counter does not exceed the maximum capacity of the parking garage to ensure safety and compliance with     â”‚            
           â”‚ garage limits. 2. **Liveness Requirement - Every Arrival Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F                 â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: For every car that arrives (triggered by the `arrival` event), it should eventually lead to an output    â”‚            
           â”‚ event that updates the display. This ensures that the system remains live and responsive to changes. 3. **Liveness Requirement - Every Departure      â”‚            
           â”‚ Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow F (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: Similarly, for every car  â”‚            
           â”‚ that departs (indicated by a `departure` event), it must eventually trigger an output event that updates the display. This ensures the display is     â”‚            
           â”‚ accurate and the system systematically tracks departures. 4. **Fairness Requirement - If Cars Arrive, They Must Eventually Leave**:  [ G              â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F (\text{departure})) \]  **Explanation**: This specification asserts that if cars are continuously arriving, then under  â”‚            
           â”‚ normal operations, they should also eventually leave. This focuses on the operational dynamics where garages do not just fill up; but also have cars  â”‚            
           â”‚ exiting. 5. **Safety Requirement - The Counter Does Not Decrease at Arrival or Increase at Departure**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow X            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} + 1)) \]  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow X (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} - 1)) \]                  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: When a car arrives, in the following state, the counter should increase by exactly one. Conversely, when a car departs, in the next  â”‚            
           â”‚ state, the counter should decrease by exactly one. These specifications prevent erroneous updates to the counter and ensure its accurate reflection   â”‚            
           â”‚ of the number of cars. These properties and behaviors are key to ensuring that the system operates safely, efficiently, and effectively, aligning     â”‚            
           â”‚ with user expectations and physical constraints in the garage environment.                                                                            â”‚

           â”‚ Limits**: If the maximum capacity of the garage is \( C \), then \( \text{counter} \leq C \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that the car   â”‚            
           â”‚ count does not exceed the total capacity of the garage, maintaining the physical constraints of the parking space.   3. **Count Consistency**: \(     â”‚

           â”‚ event that updates the display. This ensures that the system remains live and responsive to changes. 3. **Liveness Requirement - Every Departure      â”‚            
           â”‚ Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow F (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: Similarly, for every car  â”‚            
           â”‚ that departs (indicated by a `departure` event), it must eventually trigger an output event that updates the display. This ensures the display is     â”‚            
           â”‚ accurate and the system systematically tracks departures. 4. **Fairness Requirement - If Cars Arrive, They Must Eventually Leave**:  [ G              â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F (\text{departure})) \]  **Explanation**: This specification asserts that if cars are continuously arriving, then under  â”‚            
           â”‚ normal operations, they should also eventually leave. This focuses on the operational dynamics where garages do not just fill up; but also have cars  â”‚            
           â”‚ exiting. 5. **Safety Requirement - The Counter Does Not Decrease at Arrival or Increase at Departure**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow X            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} + 1)) \]  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow X (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} - 1)) \]                  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: When a car arrives, in the following state, the counter should increase by exactly one. Conversely, when a car departs, in the next  â”‚            
           â”‚ state, the counter should decrease by exactly one. These specifications prevent erroneous updates to the counter and ensure its accurate reflection   â”‚            
           â”‚ of the number of cars. These properties and behaviors are key to ensuring that the system operates safely, efficiently, and effectively, aligning     â”‚            
           â”‚ with user expectations and physical constraints in the garage environment.                                                                            â”‚

           â”‚ inside the garage cannot be negative; this invariant ensures that the counter value remains logical and realistic at all times. 2. **Counter          â”‚            
           â”‚ Limits**: If the maximum capacity of the garage is \( C \), then \( \text{counter} \leq C \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that the car   â”‚            
           â”‚ count does not exceed the total capacity of the garage, maintaining the physical constraints of the parking space.   3. **Count Consistency**: \(     â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{counter} = \text{arrivals} - \text{departures} + i \)   **Explanation**: This invariant ensures the accuracy of the count at all states,        â”‚            
           â”‚ reflecting an accurate number of cars in the garage relative to how many cars have entered and left since the beginning. ### LTL Specifications for   â”‚            
           â”‚ the Parking Garage Counter System 1. **Safety Requirement - Max Capacity Never Exceeded**:  [ G (\text{counter} \leq C) \]  **Explanation**:          â”‚            
           â”‚ Globally, it must always be true that the counter does not exceed the maximum capacity of the parking garage to ensure safety and compliance with     â”‚            
           â”‚ garage limits. 2. **Liveness Requirement - Every Arrival Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F                 â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: For every car that arrives (triggered by the `arrival` event), it should eventually lead to an output    â”‚            
           â”‚ event that updates the display. This ensures that the system remains live and responsive to changes. 3. **Liveness Requirement - Every Departure      â”‚            
           â”‚ Eventually Leads to an Updated Display**:  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow F (\text{output\_event})) \]  **Explanation**: Similarly, for every car  â”‚            
           â”‚ that departs (indicated by a `departure` event), it must eventually trigger an output event that updates the display. This ensures the display is     â”‚            
           â”‚ accurate and the system systematically tracks departures. 4. **Fairness Requirement - If Cars Arrive, They Must Eventually Leave**:  [ G              â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{arrival} \rightarrow F (\text{departure})) \]  **Explanation**: This specification asserts that if cars are continuously arriving, then under  â”‚            
           â”‚ normal operations, they should also eventually leave. This focuses on the operational dynamics where garages do not just fill up; but also have cars  â”‚            
           â”‚ exiting. 5. **Safety Requirement - The Counter Does Not Decrease at Arrival or Increase at Departure**:  [ G (\text{arrival} \rightarrow X            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} + 1)) \]  [ G (\text{departure} \rightarrow X (\text{counter} = \text{counter}_{pre} - 1)) \]                  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: When a car arrives, in the following state, the counter should increase by exactly one. Conversely, when a car departs, in the next  â”‚            
           â”‚ state, the counter should decrease by exactly one. These specifications prevent erroneous updates to the counter and ensure its accurate reflection   â”‚            
           â”‚ of the number of cars. These properties and behaviors are key to ensuring that the system operates safely, efficiently, and effectively, aligning     â”‚            
           â”‚ with user expectations and physical constraints in the garage environment.                                                                            â”‚
