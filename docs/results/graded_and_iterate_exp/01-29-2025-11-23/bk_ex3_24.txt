           â”‚ ### Invariants:                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Sufficient Coins for Drinks**: The vending machine should not dispense more drinks than the number of coins that have been inserted.             â”‚            
           â”‚    - **Invariant**: \( \text{coin} \geq \text{dispensed\_drinks} \)                                                                                   â”‚            
           â”‚    - **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that at all times, the number of drinks dispensed is at most equal to the number of coins inserted,      â”‚            
           â”‚ which reflects the requirement that each drink should be paid for by a corresponding coin.                                                            â”‚

           â”‚ 1. **Safety Property**: The machine should always maintain a non-negative balance between the coins received and the drinks dispensed to prevent      â”‚            
           â”‚ dispensing drinks without sufficient payment.                                                                                                         â”‚

           â”‚    - **Explanation**: The globally (G) operator ensures that throughout the vending machine's operation, it never happens that the number of          â”‚            
           â”‚ dispensed drinks exceeds the number of coins inserted. This specification ensures the machine adheres to the payment requirements permanently.        â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ 2. **Fairness/Starvation Property**: If there are enough coins deposited, a drink should eventually be dispensed.                                     â”‚            
           â”‚    - **LTL Specification**: \( G(\text{coin} > \text{dispensed\_drinks} \rightarrow F(\text{dispensed\_drinks} > \text{previous\_dispensed\_drinks})) â”‚            
           â”‚ \)                                                                                                                                                    â”‚            
           â”‚    - **Explanation**: This formula states that if at any point the coins inserted exceed the drinks dispensed, it must eventually lead to an increase â”‚            
           â”‚ in the `dispensed_drinks` count. Here, `previous_dispensed_drinks` is an auxiliary variable representing the count of dispensed drinks at the         â”‚            
           â”‚ previous state. This temporal logic specification is designed to prevent a scenario in which the machine stops dispensing drinks despite having       â”‚            
           â”‚ received enough coins.                                                                                                                                â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ These properties help ensure that the vending machine behaves justly and safely, adhering to the business logic that requires payment before service, â”‚            
           â”‚ while also ensuring the customer gets what they pay for without undue delay.                                                                          â”‚

           â”‚ > For a beverage vending machine system which dispenses drinks on receipt of coins, let us define some system variables and constraints. We will      â”‚            
           â”‚ formulate both invariants and LTL specifications to ensure the system operates correctly and safely under the stipulated conditions. ### System       â”‚            
           â”‚ Variables: - `coin`: Represents the number of coins inserted into the vending machine. - `dispensed_drinks`: Represents the number of drinks          â”‚            
           â”‚ dispensed by the machine. ### Invariants: 1. **Sufficient Coins for Drinks**: The vending machine should not dispense more drinks than the number of  â”‚            
           â”‚ coins that have been inserted.  - **Invariant**: \( \text{coin} \geq \text{dispensed\_drinks} \)  - **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that at   â”‚            
           â”‚ all times, the number of drinks dispensed is at most equal to the number of coins inserted, which reflects the requirement that each drink should be  â”‚            
           â”‚ paid for by a corresponding coin. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Safety Property**: The machine should always maintain a non-negative balance between   â”‚            
           â”‚ the coins received and the drinks dispensed to prevent dispensing drinks without sufficient payment.  - **LTL Specification**: \( G (\text{coin} \geq â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{dispensed\_drinks}) \)  - **Explanation**: The globally (G) operator ensures that throughout the vending machine's operation, it never happens  â”‚            
           â”‚ that the number of dispensed drinks exceeds the number of coins inserted. This specification ensures the machine adheres to the payment requirements  â”‚            
           â”‚ permanently. 2. **Fairness/Starvation Property**: If there are enough coins deposited, a drink should eventually be dispensed.  - **LTL               â”‚            
           â”‚ Specification**: \( G(\text{coin} > \text{dispensed\_drinks} \rightarrow F(\text{dispensed\_drinks} > \text{previous\_dispensed\_drinks})) \)  -      â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: This formula states that if at any point the coins inserted exceed the drinks dispensed, it must eventually lead to an increase in   â”‚            
           â”‚ the `dispensed_drinks` count. Here, `previous_dispensed_drinks` is an auxiliary variable representing the count of dispensed drinks at the previous   â”‚            
           â”‚ state. This temporal logic specification is designed to prevent a scenario in which the machine stops dispensing drinks despite having received       â”‚            
           â”‚ enough coins. These properties help ensure that the vending machine behaves justly and safely, adhering to the business logic that requires payment   â”‚            
           â”‚ before service, while also ensuring the customer gets what they pay for without undue delay.                                                          â”‚
