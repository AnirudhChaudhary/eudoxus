           â”‚ seconds have passed since they were closed. This invariant assures that the light does not remain on indefinitely and is consistent with the system's â”‚            
           â”‚ requirement to turn off 30 seconds after door closure. ### LTL Specifications 1. **LTL Spec 1:** \( \text{G} (\text{door\_open} \implies \text{X}     â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{light\_on})) \)    **Explanation:** Globally, if any door is opened, then in the next state (immediately after the door is opened), the light  â”‚            
           â”‚ should be on. This specification ensures that the light response is immediate upon door opening. 2. **LTL Spec 2:** \( \text{G} ((\text{not }         â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{door\_open}) \land \text{light\_on} \implies \text{X}(\text{light\_on} \text{U} (\text{time} \leq 30))) \)    **Explanation:** Globally, if all â”‚            
           â”‚ doors are closed (not door_open) while the light is on, the light must remain on until 30 seconds have passed. This property captures the required    â”‚            
           â”‚ behavior that the light stays on for a fixed duration post door closures. 3. **LTL Spec 3:** \( \text{G} ((\text{time} > 30) \land (\text{not }       â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{door\_open}) \implies \text{X} (\text{not } \text{light\_on})) \)    **Explanation:** Globally, if no door is open and more than 30 seconds     â”‚            
           â”‚ have passed since the last door was closed, then in the next system state, the light must be turned off. This ensures compliance with the system's    â”‚            
           â”‚ 30-second rule when doors are shut. 4. **LTL Spec 4:** \( \text{F G} (\text{not } \text{door\_open}) \implies \text{F G} (\text{not }                 â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{light\_on}) \)    **Explanation:** Eventually, if it becomes globally true that all doors remain closed, then eventually it must become         â”‚            
           â”‚ globally true that the light remains off. This specification effectively ensures that the light does not stay on indefinitely once all doors remain   â”‚            
           â”‚ closed. These specifications and invariants collectively ensure that the dome light behaves appropriately according to its operational requirements,  â”‚

           â”‚ This specification demands that if the doors are closed and the light is on, then the light remains switched on until 30 seconds have passed. The     â”‚            
           â”‚ model accommodates this condition by only turning off the light if the time is set to 30 or more and the door is not re-opened in this period. The    â”‚
