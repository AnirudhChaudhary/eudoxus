           â”‚ - **Variables (`Bit`)**: All entities (`ferryman`, `goat`, `cabbage`, `wolf`, `carry`) are represented as bits (0 or 1). This simplifies              â”‚            
           â”‚ representation but does not directly translate to 'Left' and 'Right' as described.                                                                    â”‚

           â”‚ - **Transition function (`next`)**: Reflects basic logic to move the `ferryman` along with other entities. However, it has several issues:            â”‚            
           â”‚   - It allows for moving the goat or cabbage improperly without considerations for the `wolf` or other entities.                                      â”‚            
           â”‚   - The logic only supports moving entities in a limited and somewhat incorrect fashion. For example, if `carry` is 1, nothing ensures the carried    â”‚

           â”‚ what separates the two river banks (letâ€™s denote them as `Left` and `Right`). The ferryman can carry at most one of the other three entities (goat,   â”‚            
           â”‚ cabbage, or wolf) during a crossing. The challenge is to move all three from one side (initially `Left`) to the other side (`Right`) without leaving  â”‚            
           â”‚ the goat alone with the cabbage or the goat with the wolf without the ferryman's supervision. #### Variables: - `ferryman` : {`Left`, `Right`} -      â”‚            
           â”‚ Location of the ferryman. - `goat` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the goat. - `cabbage` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the cabbage. - `wolf` :  â”‚            
           â”‚ {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the wolf. - `carry` : {`None`, `Goat`, `Cabbage`, `Wolf`} - Entity being carried by the ferryman. ### Invariants: 1.  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Conflict-Free State:**   \( \forall \text{ state}: \neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \)   This invariant asserts that it is always true that the goat is not left with  â”‚            
           â”‚ either the cabbage or the wolf without the ferryman present. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Reachable Goal State:**   \( F (\text{ferryman} =           â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{Right} \land \text{goat} = \text{Right} \land \text{cabbage} = \text{Right} \land \text{wolf} = \text{Right}) \)   This LTL formula expresses   â”‚            
           â”‚ that eventually all entities (ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf) will be on the `Right` side, which is our goal state. 2. **Safety Requirement:**   \( G  â”‚            
           â”‚ (\neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq          â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{goat})) \)   This specifies that globally (at all times) it must be ensured that the goat and cabbage are not left alone without the ferryman,  â”‚            
           â”‚ and similarly, the goat and wolf are not left alone without the ferryman. This aligns with the invariant but is represented in temporal logic to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify consistency over time. 3. **Progress Requirement:**   \( G (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right} \rightarrow F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left})) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that if the ferryman is on the right, he must eventually return to the left, ensuring continuing operation (progress of the ferryman to  â”‚            
           â”‚ move back and forth as required). 4. **Fairness in Operation:**   \( G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left}) \land G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right})   â”‚            
           â”‚ \)   This specification ensures that the ferryman goes to both sides infinitely often, showing fairness in operation, preventing deadlock or          â”‚            
           â”‚ starvation for any entities waiting to be transferred. ### Explanation: - The conflict-free state invariant ensures, at all points, that there are no â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the goat is endangered by being left with the cabbage or wolf while unsupervised. - The LTL specifications outline both the           â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements to reach the desired end state and the need to maintain safety throughout the operations continuously. They also ensure operational      â”‚            
           â”‚ fairness and progress, ensuring the ferryman continues his tasks without indefinitely staying on one side.                                            â”‚

           â”‚ > ### System Model Description In the ferryman puzzle, we have four primary entities: the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage, and the wolf. The river is â”‚            
           â”‚ what separates the two river banks (letâ€™s denote them as `Left` and `Right`). The ferryman can carry at most one of the other three entities (goat,   â”‚            
           â”‚ cabbage, or wolf) during a crossing. The challenge is to move all three from one side (initially `Left`) to the other side (`Right`) without leaving  â”‚            
           â”‚ the goat alone with the cabbage or the goat with the wolf without the ferryman's supervision. #### Variables: - `ferryman` : {`Left`, `Right`} -      â”‚            
           â”‚ Location of the ferryman. - `goat` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the goat. - `cabbage` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the cabbage. - `wolf` :  â”‚            
           â”‚ {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the wolf. - `carry` : {`None`, `Goat`, `Cabbage`, `Wolf`} - Entity being carried by the ferryman. ### Invariants: 1.  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Conflict-Free State:**   \( \forall \text{ state}: \neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \)   This invariant asserts that it is always true that the goat is not left with  â”‚            
           â”‚ either the cabbage or the wolf without the ferryman present. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Reachable Goal State:**   \( F (\text{ferryman} =           â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{Right} \land \text{goat} = \text{Right} \land \text{cabbage} = \text{Right} \land \text{wolf} = \text{Right}) \)   This LTL formula expresses   â”‚            
           â”‚ that eventually all entities (ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf) will be on the `Right` side, which is our goal state. 2. **Safety Requirement:**   \( G  â”‚            
           â”‚ (\neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq          â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{goat})) \)   This specifies that globally (at all times) it must be ensured that the goat and cabbage are not left alone without the ferryman,  â”‚            
           â”‚ and similarly, the goat and wolf are not left alone without the ferryman. This aligns with the invariant but is represented in temporal logic to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify consistency over time. 3. **Progress Requirement:**   \( G (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right} \rightarrow F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left})) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that if the ferryman is on the right, he must eventually return to the left, ensuring continuing operation (progress of the ferryman to  â”‚            
           â”‚ move back and forth as required). 4. **Fairness in Operation:**   \( G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left}) \land G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right})   â”‚            
           â”‚ \)   This specification ensures that the ferryman goes to both sides infinitely often, showing fairness in operation, preventing deadlock or          â”‚            
           â”‚ starvation for any entities waiting to be transferred. ### Explanation: - The conflict-free state invariant ensures, at all points, that there are no â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the goat is endangered by being left with the cabbage or wolf while unsupervised. - The LTL specifications outline both the           â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements to reach the desired end state and the need to maintain safety throughout the operations continuously. They also ensure operational      â”‚            
           â”‚ fairness and progress, ensuring the ferryman continues his tasks without indefinitely staying on one side.                                            â”‚

           â”‚ > ### System Model Description In the ferryman puzzle, we have four primary entities: the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage, and the wolf. The river is â”‚            
           â”‚ what separates the two river banks (letâ€™s denote them as `Left` and `Right`). The ferryman can carry at most one of the other three entities (goat,   â”‚            
           â”‚ cabbage, or wolf) during a crossing. The challenge is to move all three from one side (initially `Left`) to the other side (`Right`) without leaving  â”‚            
           â”‚ the goat alone with the cabbage or the goat with the wolf without the ferryman's supervision. #### Variables: - `ferryman` : {`Left`, `Right`} -      â”‚            
           â”‚ Location of the ferryman. - `goat` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the goat. - `cabbage` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the cabbage. - `wolf` :  â”‚            
           â”‚ {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the wolf. - `carry` : {`None`, `Goat`, `Cabbage`, `Wolf`} - Entity being carried by the ferryman. ### Invariants: 1.  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Conflict-Free State:**   \( \forall \text{ state}: \neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \)   This invariant asserts that it is always true that the goat is not left with  â”‚            
           â”‚ either the cabbage or the wolf without the ferryman present. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Reachable Goal State:**   \( F (\text{ferryman} =           â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{Right} \land \text{goat} = \text{Right} \land \text{cabbage} = \text{Right} \land \text{wolf} = \text{Right}) \)   This LTL formula expresses   â”‚            
           â”‚ that eventually all entities (ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf) will be on the `Right` side, which is our goal state. 2. **Safety Requirement:**   \( G  â”‚            
           â”‚ (\neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq          â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{goat})) \)   This specifies that globally (at all times) it must be ensured that the goat and cabbage are not left alone without the ferryman,  â”‚            
           â”‚ and similarly, the goat and wolf are not left alone without the ferryman. This aligns with the invariant but is represented in temporal logic to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify consistency over time. 3. **Progress Requirement:**   \( G (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right} \rightarrow F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left})) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that if the ferryman is on the right, he must eventually return to the left, ensuring continuing operation (progress of the ferryman to  â”‚            
           â”‚ move back and forth as required). 4. **Fairness in Operation:**   \( G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left}) \land G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right})   â”‚            
           â”‚ \)   This specification ensures that the ferryman goes to both sides infinitely often, showing fairness in operation, preventing deadlock or          â”‚            
           â”‚ starvation for any entities waiting to be transferred. ### Explanation: - The conflict-free state invariant ensures, at all points, that there are no â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the goat is endangered by being left with the cabbage or wolf while unsupervised. - The LTL specifications outline both the           â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements to reach the desired end state and the need to maintain safety throughout the operations continuously. They also ensure operational      â”‚            
           â”‚ fairness and progress, ensuring the ferryman continues his tasks without indefinitely staying on one side.                                            â”‚

           â”‚ > ### System Model Description In the ferryman puzzle, we have four primary entities: the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage, and the wolf. The river is â”‚            
           â”‚ what separates the two river banks (letâ€™s denote them as `Left` and `Right`). The ferryman can carry at most one of the other three entities (goat,   â”‚            
           â”‚ cabbage, or wolf) during a crossing. The challenge is to move all three from one side (initially `Left`) to the other side (`Right`) without leaving  â”‚            
           â”‚ the goat alone with the cabbage or the goat with the wolf without the ferryman's supervision. #### Variables: - `ferryman` : {`Left`, `Right`} -      â”‚            
           â”‚ Location of the ferryman. - `goat` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the goat. - `cabbage` : {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the cabbage. - `wolf` :  â”‚            
           â”‚ {`Left`, `Right`} - Location of the wolf. - `carry` : {`None`, `Goat`, `Cabbage`, `Wolf`} - Entity being carried by the ferryman. ### Invariants: 1.  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Conflict-Free State:**   \( \forall \text{ state}: \neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \)   This invariant asserts that it is always true that the goat is not left with  â”‚            
           â”‚ either the cabbage or the wolf without the ferryman present. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Reachable Goal State:**   \( F (\text{ferryman} =           â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{Right} \land \text{goat} = \text{Right} \land \text{cabbage} = \text{Right} \land \text{wolf} = \text{Right}) \)   This LTL formula expresses   â”‚            
           â”‚ that eventually all entities (ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf) will be on the `Right` side, which is our goal state. 2. **Safety Requirement:**   \( G  â”‚            
           â”‚ (\neg (\text{goat} = \text{cabbage} \land \text{ferryman} \neq \text{goat}) \land \neg (\text{goat} = \text{wolf} \land \text{ferryman} \neq          â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{goat})) \)   This specifies that globally (at all times) it must be ensured that the goat and cabbage are not left alone without the ferryman,  â”‚            
           â”‚ and similarly, the goat and wolf are not left alone without the ferryman. This aligns with the invariant but is represented in temporal logic to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify consistency over time. 3. **Progress Requirement:**   \( G (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right} \rightarrow F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left})) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that if the ferryman is on the right, he must eventually return to the left, ensuring continuing operation (progress of the ferryman to  â”‚            
           â”‚ move back and forth as required). 4. **Fairness in Operation:**   \( G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Left}) \land G F (\text{ferryman} = \text{Right})   â”‚            
           â”‚ \)   This specification ensures that the ferryman goes to both sides infinitely often, showing fairness in operation, preventing deadlock or          â”‚            
           â”‚ starvation for any entities waiting to be transferred. ### Explanation: - The conflict-free state invariant ensures, at all points, that there are no â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the goat is endangered by being left with the cabbage or wolf while unsupervised. - The LTL specifications outline both the           â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements to reach the desired end state and the need to maintain safety throughout the operations continuously. They also ensure operational      â”‚            
           â”‚ fairness and progress, ensuring the ferryman continues his tasks without indefinitely staying on one side.                                            â”‚
