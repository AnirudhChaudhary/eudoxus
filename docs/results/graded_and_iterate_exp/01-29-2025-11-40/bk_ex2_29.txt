           â”‚ > Consider a (strongly simplified) booking system at a cashier of a supermarket. The system consists of three processes: the bar code reader BCR, the â”‚            
           â”‚ actual booking program BP, and the printer Printer. The bar code reader reads a bar code and communicates the data of the just scanned product to the â”‚            
           â”‚ booking program. On receiving such data, the booking program transmits the price of the article to the printer that prints the article Id together    â”‚            
           â”‚ with the price on the receipt. The interactions between the bar code reader and the booking program, and between the booking program and the printer  â”‚            
           â”‚ is performed by handshaking. Each process consist of just two states, named 0 and 1. BCR transitions from state 0 to state 1 when a bar code is       â”‚            
           â”‚ scanned, and from state 1 to state 0 when the data is sent to BP. BP transitions from state 0 to state 1 when it receives data from BCR, and from     â”‚            
           â”‚ state 1 to state 0 when it sends the print command to the printer Printer transitions from state 0 to state 1 when the print code is sent by BP, and  â”‚            
           â”‚ from state 1 to state 0 when the article is printed.  The complete system is given by: BCR || BP || Printer. Model this system. Use the variable      â”‚

           â”‚ either 0 or 1. This invariant ensures that BCR's state remains valid throughout the systemâ€™s operation. 2. **BP_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation:      â”‚            
           â”‚ Similar to the bar code reader, the booking program (BP) must only be in one of two possible states (0 or 1) at any time, maintaining the validity of â”‚            
           â”‚ BPâ€™s operational states. 3. **Printer_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation: This invariant asserts that the state of the printer can either be 0 or 1,     â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring it remains in a valid state within its operation parameters. 4. **(BCR_state = 1) â†’ (BP_state = 1)**  - Explanation: Whenever the bar code   â”‚            
           â”‚ reader is in state 1 (data has been read and is ready to send), the booking program should also be in state 1 (indicating it is ready to receive      â”‚            
           â”‚ data). This maintains the handshake protocol integrity between BCR and BP. 5. **(BP_state = 1) â†’ (Printer_state = 1)**  - Explanation: This invariant â”‚            
           â”‚ details that if the booking program is in state 1 (received data from BCR and is sending data to the printer), then the printer must be in state 1 to â”‚            
           â”‚ receive and begin printing. This ensures coordinated handshaking between BP and Printer. ### LTL Specifications for the Supermarket Booking System 1. â”‚            
           â”‚ **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(Printer_state = 1))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1 in a given state, in the next state, the    â”‚            
           â”‚ printer must be transitioning to state 1. This LTL formula ensures a guaranteed sequence of operations between BP sending the print command and       â”‚            
           â”‚ Printer receiving it. 2. **G(BCR_state = 1 â†’ X(BP_state = 1))**  - Explanation: This spec dictates that globally when the BCR is in state 1, in the   â”‚            
           â”‚ subsequent state, BP should be in state 1. It guarantees the correct sequence of data handover from BCR to BP. 3. **G(F(BCR_state = 1))**  -          â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: It's required that globally, it will eventually be true that BCR_state will be 1. This ensures the liveness of BCR in terms of scanning  â”‚            
           â”‚ items, as it guarantees that BCR will regularly scan products. 4. **G(Printer_state = 1 â†’ F(Printer_state = 0))**  - Explanation: Globally, whenever  â”‚            
           â”‚ the printer transitions to state 1 (starts printing), it must eventually return to state 0 (finish printing). This specification ensures that the     â”‚            
           â”‚ printer does not stay stuck in the printing state, completing its tasks and allowing for further operations. 5. **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(G(Printer_state  â”‚            
           â”‚ = 1)))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1, it must lead to the printer being eventually globally in state 1 until the   â”‚            
           â”‚ printing command is processed. This ensures the printer eventually starts printing after BP sends the print command, and continues correctly          â”‚            
           â”‚ processing tasks. These invariants and LTL specifications not only cover the immediate operational requirements of the components within the booking  â”‚            
           â”‚ system but also ensure that each component communicates and transitions state correctly relative to each other, maintaining the systemâ€™s integrity    â”‚            
           â”‚ and functionality.                                                                                                                                    â”‚

           â”‚ **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(Printer_state = 1))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1 in a given state, in the next state, the    â”‚            
           â”‚ printer must be transitioning to state 1. This LTL formula ensures a guaranteed sequence of operations between BP sending the print command and       â”‚            
           â”‚ Printer receiving it. 2. **G(BCR_state = 1 â†’ X(BP_state = 1))**  - Explanation: This spec dictates that globally when the BCR is in state 1, in the   â”‚            
           â”‚ subsequent state, BP should be in state 1. It guarantees the correct sequence of data handover from BCR to BP. 3. **G(F(BCR_state = 1))**  -          â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: It's required that globally, it will eventually be true that BCR_state will be 1. This ensures the liveness of BCR in terms of scanning  â”‚            
           â”‚ items, as it guarantees that BCR will regularly scan products. 4. **G(Printer_state = 1 â†’ F(Printer_state = 0))**  - Explanation: Globally, whenever  â”‚            
           â”‚ the printer transitions to state 1 (starts printing), it must eventually return to state 0 (finish printing). This specification ensures that the     â”‚            
           â”‚ printer does not stay stuck in the printing state, completing its tasks and allowing for further operations. 5. **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(G(Printer_state  â”‚            
           â”‚ = 1)))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1, it must lead to the printer being eventually globally in state 1 until the   â”‚            
           â”‚ printing command is processed. This ensures the printer eventually starts printing after BP sends the print command, and continues correctly          â”‚            
           â”‚ processing tasks. These invariants and LTL specifications not only cover the immediate operational requirements of the components within the booking  â”‚            
           â”‚ system but also ensure that each component communicates and transitions state correctly relative to each other, maintaining the systemâ€™s integrity    â”‚

           â”‚ either 0 or 1. This invariant ensures that BCR's state remains valid throughout the systemâ€™s operation. 2. **BP_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation:      â”‚            
           â”‚ Similar to the bar code reader, the booking program (BP) must only be in one of two possible states (0 or 1) at any time, maintaining the validity of â”‚            
           â”‚ BPâ€™s operational states. 3. **Printer_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation: This invariant asserts that the state of the printer can either be 0 or 1,     â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring it remains in a valid state within its operation parameters. 4. **(BCR_state = 1) â†’ (BP_state = 1)**  - Explanation: Whenever the bar code   â”‚            
           â”‚ reader is in state 1 (data has been read and is ready to send), the booking program should also be in state 1 (indicating it is ready to receive      â”‚            
           â”‚ data). This maintains the handshake protocol integrity between BCR and BP. 5. **(BP_state = 1) â†’ (Printer_state = 1)**  - Explanation: This invariant â”‚            
           â”‚ details that if the booking program is in state 1 (received data from BCR and is sending data to the printer), then the printer must be in state 1 to â”‚            
           â”‚ receive and begin printing. This ensures coordinated handshaking between BP and Printer. ### LTL Specifications for the Supermarket Booking System 1. â”‚            
           â”‚ **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(Printer_state = 1))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1 in a given state, in the next state, the    â”‚            
           â”‚ printer must be transitioning to state 1. This LTL formula ensures a guaranteed sequence of operations between BP sending the print command and       â”‚            
           â”‚ Printer receiving it. 2. **G(BCR_state = 1 â†’ X(BP_state = 1))**  - Explanation: This spec dictates that globally when the BCR is in state 1, in the   â”‚            
           â”‚ subsequent state, BP should be in state 1. It guarantees the correct sequence of data handover from BCR to BP. 3. **G(F(BCR_state = 1))**  -          â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: It's required that globally, it will eventually be true that BCR_state will be 1. This ensures the liveness of BCR in terms of scanning  â”‚            
           â”‚ items, as it guarantees that BCR will regularly scan products. 4. **G(Printer_state = 1 â†’ F(Printer_state = 0))**  - Explanation: Globally, whenever  â”‚            
           â”‚ the printer transitions to state 1 (starts printing), it must eventually return to state 0 (finish printing). This specification ensures that the     â”‚            
           â”‚ printer does not stay stuck in the printing state, completing its tasks and allowing for further operations. 5. **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(G(Printer_state  â”‚            
           â”‚ = 1)))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1, it must lead to the printer being eventually globally in state 1 until the   â”‚            
           â”‚ printing command is processed. This ensures the printer eventually starts printing after BP sends the print command, and continues correctly          â”‚            
           â”‚ processing tasks. These invariants and LTL specifications not only cover the immediate operational requirements of the components within the booking  â”‚            
           â”‚ system but also ensure that each component communicates and transitions state correctly relative to each other, maintaining the systemâ€™s integrity    â”‚

           â”‚ either 0 or 1. This invariant ensures that BCR's state remains valid throughout the systemâ€™s operation. 2. **BP_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation:      â”‚            
           â”‚ Similar to the bar code reader, the booking program (BP) must only be in one of two possible states (0 or 1) at any time, maintaining the validity of â”‚            
           â”‚ BPâ€™s operational states. 3. **Printer_state âˆˆ {0, 1}**  - Explanation: This invariant asserts that the state of the printer can either be 0 or 1,     â”‚            
           â”‚ ensuring it remains in a valid state within its operation parameters. 4. **(BCR_state = 1) â†’ (BP_state = 1)**  - Explanation: Whenever the bar code   â”‚            
           â”‚ reader is in state 1 (data has been read and is ready to send), the booking program should also be in state 1 (indicating it is ready to receive      â”‚            
           â”‚ data). This maintains the handshake protocol integrity between BCR and BP. 5. **(BP_state = 1) â†’ (Printer_state = 1)**  - Explanation: This invariant â”‚            
           â”‚ details that if the booking program is in state 1 (received data from BCR and is sending data to the printer), then the printer must be in state 1 to â”‚            
           â”‚ receive and begin printing. This ensures coordinated handshaking between BP and Printer. ### LTL Specifications for the Supermarket Booking System 1. â”‚            
           â”‚ **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(Printer_state = 1))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1 in a given state, in the next state, the    â”‚            
           â”‚ printer must be transitioning to state 1. This LTL formula ensures a guaranteed sequence of operations between BP sending the print command and       â”‚            
           â”‚ Printer receiving it. 2. **G(BCR_state = 1 â†’ X(BP_state = 1))**  - Explanation: This spec dictates that globally when the BCR is in state 1, in the   â”‚            
           â”‚ subsequent state, BP should be in state 1. It guarantees the correct sequence of data handover from BCR to BP. 3. **G(F(BCR_state = 1))**  -          â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: It's required that globally, it will eventually be true that BCR_state will be 1. This ensures the liveness of BCR in terms of scanning  â”‚            
           â”‚ items, as it guarantees that BCR will regularly scan products. 4. **G(Printer_state = 1 â†’ F(Printer_state = 0))**  - Explanation: Globally, whenever  â”‚            
           â”‚ the printer transitions to state 1 (starts printing), it must eventually return to state 0 (finish printing). This specification ensures that the     â”‚            
           â”‚ printer does not stay stuck in the printing state, completing its tasks and allowing for further operations. 5. **G(BP_state = 1 â†’ X(G(Printer_state  â”‚            
           â”‚ = 1)))**  - Explanation: Globally, if the booking program is in state 1, it must lead to the printer being eventually globally in state 1 until the   â”‚            
           â”‚ printing command is processed. This ensures the printer eventually starts printing after BP sends the print command, and continues correctly          â”‚            
           â”‚ processing tasks. These invariants and LTL specifications not only cover the immediate operational requirements of the components within the booking  â”‚            
           â”‚ system but also ensure that each component communicates and transitions state correctly relative to each other, maintaining the systemâ€™s integrity    â”‚
