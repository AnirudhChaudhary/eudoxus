           â”‚    **Explanation**: Globally, if `x` is even, then in the next state following some action, `x` must be odd. This derives from noting that when `x`   â”‚

           â”‚ > ### System Model Let's begin by developing a formal model for this parallel system, which involves two actions operating on a shared variable `x`.  â”‚            
           â”‚ Originally, `x` is initialized to 3. The system can execute the two actions concurrently: 1. **Action A**: Doubles the value of `x` (`x := 2 * x`).   â”‚            
           â”‚ 2. **Action B**: Increments the value of `x` by 1 (`x := x + 1`). ### Invariants Invariant properties are those that are true in every state of the   â”‚            
           â”‚ system. For this system, it's crucial to specify conditions about the shared variable `x` considering both actions can alter its value. 1.            â”‚            
           â”‚ **Invariant I1**: \( x \geq 3 \)    **Explanation**: Since `x` starts at 3 and both actions either multiply or increment the value, `x` will never be â”‚            
           â”‚ less than the initial value. ### LTL Specifications Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications will help us express how the properties of the system  â”‚            
           â”‚ evolve over time. Given the concurrency and action descriptions, we consider the interactions and effects over time: 1. **LTL Specification S1**: \(  â”‚            
           â”‚ G (x \geq 3) \)   **Explanation**: Globally, the value of `x` is always greater than or equal to 3. This is consistent with our invariant and follows â”‚            
           â”‚ from the initialization and types of operations performed on `x`. 2. **LTL Specification S2**: \( G \neg(\text{Final}(x) < 3) \)   **Explanation**:   â”‚            
           â”‚ It is globally true that it is never the case that `x` will eventually be less than 3. The negation of a "final" less-than-3 state for `x` is         â”‚            
           â”‚ specified to ensure that all future projections of the system maintain `x` at or above 3. 3. **LTL Specification S3**: \( G (x := 2 * x \rightarrow F â”‚            
           â”‚ (x := x + 1)) \)   **Explanation**: Globally, if the action `x := 2 * x` occurs, then eventually the action `x := x + 1` will follow. This            â”‚            
           â”‚ specification anticipates that increments will eventually follow multiplications to reflect concurrency; however, exact sequential obligations are    â”‚            
           â”‚ not necessarily guaranteed due to the parallel nature of the actions. 4. **LTL Specification S4**: \( G (x % 2 = 0 \rightarrow XF (x % 2 \neq 0)) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ **Explanation**: Globally, if `x` is even, then in the next state following some action, `x` must be odd. This derives from noting that when `x` is   â”‚            
           â”‚ doubled (even times even is even), the subsequent increment will turn it odd, illustrating the alternating state of `x`â€™s parity due to the           â”‚            
           â”‚ operations. These properties provide a basic formal characterization of the system, focusing on the persistent nature of `x`'s value, the likelihood  â”‚            
           â”‚ of operations alternating consistently in the model, and ensuring that the logical flow governed by potential parallel executions remains             â”‚

           â”‚ **S4** concerns the parity of `x`. It specifies that if `x` is even, then immediately in the next state (or soon after an unspecified number of       â”‚            
           â”‚ actions), `x` must become odd. Given the model's operation, if `x` is initially even, it is incremented by 1 (making it odd immediately); if odd,     â”‚            
           â”‚ it's doubled (and remains odd or becomes even). However, the "next" state after an even `x` can be directly followed by `x` remaining even if doubled â”‚            
           â”‚ (when placed after incrementing an odd `x`), which would conflict with this property as implemented.                                                  â”‚

           â”‚ The model addresses most of the invariants and LTL specifications effectively, particularly regarding the growth and non-decrease of `x`. However,    â”‚            
           â”‚ the specifics of the parity change in S4 are not guaranteed consistently due to the possible subsequent doubling of an even number.                   â”‚
