           â”‚ > To design a model for the traffic light system at a street junction with a focus on ensuring proper light sequences and safety, we will define both â”‚            
           â”‚ system invariants and LTL specifications. The model consists of four traffic lights (L1, L2, L3, L4) each capable of being in one of four states:     â”‚            
           â”‚ green, yellow, red, amber. ### Invariants: These properties must hold true in all states of the system to ensure safety and correctness. 1. **Mutual  â”‚            
           â”‚ Exclusion of Traffic Light States**:  [  \text{(L1 = green) \lor (L1 = yellow) \lor (L1 = red) \lor (L1 = amber)} = \text{True}  \]  This invariant   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensures that each traffic light can only be in one of the defined states at any given point in time. 2. **Non-Overlap Green Light**:  [  \text{(L1 =  â”‚            
           â”‚ green)} \implies \text{(L2 = red) \land (L3 = green) \land (L4 = red)}  \]  When L1 and L3 are green, L2 and L4 must be red. This is crucial to avoid â”‚            
           â”‚ accidents due to conflicting green lights. 3. **Sequential Light Order Enforcement**:  - For each light:   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = green)} \implies  â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{next(L\textit{i} = yellow)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = yellow)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = red)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} =    â”‚            
           â”‚ red)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = green \text { or } L\textit{i} = amber)}   \]  These invariants ensure that traffic lights follow the correct â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence: green, yellow, and red. ### LTL Specifications: These capture the essential temporal operations and guarantees of the traffic light system. â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Always Eventually Green**:  [  (G (F(L1 = green)) \land G (F(L2 = green)) \land G (F(L3 = green)) \land G (F(L4 = green)))  \]  This             â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that each light will eventually turn green, guaranteeing that traffic flowing through each road will at some point be allowed   â”‚            
           â”‚ to proceed, evidently ensuring fairness in traffic management. 2. **Safety Specification**:  [  G (\text{L1 = green} \implies ((\text{L2 = red})      â”‚            
           â”‚ \land (\text{L3 = green}) \land (\text{L4 = red})))  \]  This specification ensures that whenever L1 is green, L3 is also green, while L2 and L4 are  â”‚            
           â”‚ red, enforcing the non-overlapping rule globally. 3. **Proper Transition to Amber**:  [  G (\text{L\textit{i} = yellow} \implies (\text{X(L\textit{i} â”‚            
           â”‚ = red)}))  \]  Each light that goes yellow must be followed immediately by a red state, ensuring there is always a buffer state before it turns back  â”‚            
           â”‚ to green preventing direct jumps. This is critical for pedestrian safety. By adhering to these invariant and LTL specifications, the traffic light    â”‚            
           â”‚ system can operate smoothly, efficiently, and most importantly, safely. Each property ensures that all conditions â€“ mutual exclusions of states,      â”‚            
           â”‚ proper sequential transitions, and global protections against state conflicts â€“ are rigorously maintained, avoiding any scenario that could           â”‚            
           â”‚ potentially lead to traffic hazards or inefficiencies.                                                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ > To design a model for the traffic light system at a street junction with a focus on ensuring proper light sequences and safety, we will define both â”‚            
           â”‚ system invariants and LTL specifications. The model consists of four traffic lights (L1, L2, L3, L4) each capable of being in one of four states:     â”‚            
           â”‚ green, yellow, red, amber. ### Invariants: These properties must hold true in all states of the system to ensure safety and correctness. 1. **Mutual  â”‚            
           â”‚ Exclusion of Traffic Light States**:  [  \text{(L1 = green) \lor (L1 = yellow) \lor (L1 = red) \lor (L1 = amber)} = \text{True}  \]  This invariant   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensures that each traffic light can only be in one of the defined states at any given point in time. 2. **Non-Overlap Green Light**:  [  \text{(L1 =  â”‚            
           â”‚ green)} \implies \text{(L2 = red) \land (L3 = green) \land (L4 = red)}  \]  When L1 and L3 are green, L2 and L4 must be red. This is crucial to avoid â”‚            
           â”‚ accidents due to conflicting green lights. 3. **Sequential Light Order Enforcement**:  - For each light:   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = green)} \implies  â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{next(L\textit{i} = yellow)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = yellow)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = red)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} =    â”‚            
           â”‚ red)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = green \text { or } L\textit{i} = amber)}   \]  These invariants ensure that traffic lights follow the correct â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence: green, yellow, and red. ### LTL Specifications: These capture the essential temporal operations and guarantees of the traffic light system. â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Always Eventually Green**:  [  (G (F(L1 = green)) \land G (F(L2 = green)) \land G (F(L3 = green)) \land G (F(L4 = green)))  \]  This             â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that each light will eventually turn green, guaranteeing that traffic flowing through each road will at some point be allowed   â”‚            
           â”‚ to proceed, evidently ensuring fairness in traffic management. 2. **Safety Specification**:  [  G (\text{L1 = green} \implies ((\text{L2 = red})      â”‚            
           â”‚ \land (\text{L3 = green}) \land (\text{L4 = red})))  \]  This specification ensures that whenever L1 is green, L3 is also green, while L2 and L4 are  â”‚            
           â”‚ red, enforcing the non-overlapping rule globally. 3. **Proper Transition to Amber**:  [  G (\text{L\textit{i} = yellow} \implies (\text{X(L\textit{i} â”‚            
           â”‚ = red)}))  \]  Each light that goes yellow must be followed immediately by a red state, ensuring there is always a buffer state before it turns back  â”‚            
           â”‚ to green preventing direct jumps. This is critical for pedestrian safety. By adhering to these invariant and LTL specifications, the traffic light    â”‚            
           â”‚ system can operate smoothly, efficiently, and most importantly, safely. Each property ensures that all conditions â€“ mutual exclusions of states,      â”‚            
           â”‚ proper sequential transitions, and global protections against state conflicts â€“ are rigorously maintained, avoiding any scenario that could           â”‚            
           â”‚ potentially lead to traffic hazards or inefficiencies.                                                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ > To design a model for the traffic light system at a street junction with a focus on ensuring proper light sequences and safety, we will define both â”‚            
           â”‚ system invariants and LTL specifications. The model consists of four traffic lights (L1, L2, L3, L4) each capable of being in one of four states:     â”‚            
           â”‚ green, yellow, red, amber. ### Invariants: These properties must hold true in all states of the system to ensure safety and correctness. 1. **Mutual  â”‚            
           â”‚ Exclusion of Traffic Light States**:  [  \text{(L1 = green) \lor (L1 = yellow) \lor (L1 = red) \lor (L1 = amber)} = \text{True}  \]  This invariant   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensures that each traffic light can only be in one of the defined states at any given point in time. 2. **Non-Overlap Green Light**:  [  \text{(L1 =  â”‚            
           â”‚ green)} \implies \text{(L2 = red) \land (L3 = green) \land (L4 = red)}  \]  When L1 and L3 are green, L2 and L4 must be red. This is crucial to avoid â”‚            
           â”‚ accidents due to conflicting green lights. 3. **Sequential Light Order Enforcement**:  - For each light:   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = green)} \implies  â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{next(L\textit{i} = yellow)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = yellow)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = red)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} =    â”‚            
           â”‚ red)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = green \text { or } L\textit{i} = amber)}   \]  These invariants ensure that traffic lights follow the correct â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence: green, yellow, and red. ### LTL Specifications: These capture the essential temporal operations and guarantees of the traffic light system. â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Always Eventually Green**:  [  (G (F(L1 = green)) \land G (F(L2 = green)) \land G (F(L3 = green)) \land G (F(L4 = green)))  \]  This             â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that each light will eventually turn green, guaranteeing that traffic flowing through each road will at some point be allowed   â”‚            
           â”‚ to proceed, evidently ensuring fairness in traffic management. 2. **Safety Specification**:  [  G (\text{L1 = green} \implies ((\text{L2 = red})      â”‚            
           â”‚ \land (\text{L3 = green}) \land (\text{L4 = red})))  \]  This specification ensures that whenever L1 is green, L3 is also green, while L2 and L4 are  â”‚            
           â”‚ red, enforcing the non-overlapping rule globally. 3. **Proper Transition to Amber**:  [  G (\text{L\textit{i} = yellow} \implies (\text{X(L\textit{i} â”‚            
           â”‚ = red)}))  \]  Each light that goes yellow must be followed immediately by a red state, ensuring there is always a buffer state before it turns back  â”‚            
           â”‚ to green preventing direct jumps. This is critical for pedestrian safety. By adhering to these invariant and LTL specifications, the traffic light    â”‚            
           â”‚ system can operate smoothly, efficiently, and most importantly, safely. Each property ensures that all conditions â€“ mutual exclusions of states,      â”‚            
           â”‚ proper sequential transitions, and global protections against state conflicts â€“ are rigorously maintained, avoiding any scenario that could           â”‚            
           â”‚ potentially lead to traffic hazards or inefficiencies.                                                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ `yellow`, `red`, `amber`); rather, it assumes them to be booleans. Such a modeling method contradicts the necessity that each light (e.g., `L1`) be   â”‚            
           â”‚ distinctly in one of the four possible states.                                                                                                        â”‚

           â”‚ > To design a model for the traffic light system at a street junction with a focus on ensuring proper light sequences and safety, we will define both â”‚            
           â”‚ system invariants and LTL specifications. The model consists of four traffic lights (L1, L2, L3, L4) each capable of being in one of four states:     â”‚            
           â”‚ green, yellow, red, amber. ### Invariants: These properties must hold true in all states of the system to ensure safety and correctness. 1. **Mutual  â”‚            
           â”‚ Exclusion of Traffic Light States**:  [  \text{(L1 = green) \lor (L1 = yellow) \lor (L1 = red) \lor (L1 = amber)} = \text{True}  \]  This invariant   â”‚            
           â”‚ ensures that each traffic light can only be in one of the defined states at any given point in time. 2. **Non-Overlap Green Light**:  [  \text{(L1 =  â”‚            
           â”‚ green)} \implies \text{(L2 = red) \land (L3 = green) \land (L4 = red)}  \]  When L1 and L3 are green, L2 and L4 must be red. This is crucial to avoid â”‚            
           â”‚ accidents due to conflicting green lights. 3. **Sequential Light Order Enforcement**:  - For each light:   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = green)} \implies  â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{next(L\textit{i} = yellow)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} = yellow)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = red)}   \]   [   \text{(L\textit{i} =    â”‚            
           â”‚ red)} \implies \text{next(L\textit{i} = green \text { or } L\textit{i} = amber)}   \]  These invariants ensure that traffic lights follow the correct â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence: green, yellow, and red. ### LTL Specifications: These capture the essential temporal operations and guarantees of the traffic light system. â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Always Eventually Green**:  [  (G (F(L1 = green)) \land G (F(L2 = green)) \land G (F(L3 = green)) \land G (F(L4 = green)))  \]  This             â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that each light will eventually turn green, guaranteeing that traffic flowing through each road will at some point be allowed   â”‚            
           â”‚ to proceed, evidently ensuring fairness in traffic management. 2. **Safety Specification**:  [  G (\text{L1 = green} \implies ((\text{L2 = red})      â”‚            
           â”‚ \land (\text{L3 = green}) \land (\text{L4 = red})))  \]  This specification ensures that whenever L1 is green, L3 is also green, while L2 and L4 are  â”‚            
           â”‚ red, enforcing the non-overlapping rule globally. 3. **Proper Transition to Amber**:  [  G (\text{L\textit{i} = yellow} \implies (\text{X(L\textit{i} â”‚            
           â”‚ = red)}))  \]  Each light that goes yellow must be followed immediately by a red state, ensuring there is always a buffer state before it turns back  â”‚            
           â”‚ to green preventing direct jumps. This is critical for pedestrian safety. By adhering to these invariant and LTL specifications, the traffic light    â”‚            
           â”‚ system can operate smoothly, efficiently, and most importantly, safely. Each property ensures that all conditions â€“ mutual exclusions of states,      â”‚            
           â”‚ proper sequential transitions, and global protections against state conflicts â€“ are rigorously maintained, avoiding any scenario that could           â”‚            
           â”‚ potentially lead to traffic hazards or inefficiencies.                                                                                                â”‚
