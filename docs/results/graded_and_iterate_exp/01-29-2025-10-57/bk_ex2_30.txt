           â”‚ > For a railroad crossing a control system needs to be developed that on receipt of a signal indicating that a train is approaching closes the gates, â”‚            
           â”‚ and only opens these gates after the train has sent a signal indicating that it crossed the road. The requirement that should be met by the control   â”‚            
           â”‚ system is that the gates are always closed when the train is crossing the road. The complete system consists of the three components Train, Gate, and â”‚            
           â”‚ Controller: Train || Gate || Controller.  Model this system. You can assume that all trains pass the relevant track section in the same direction.    â”‚            
           â”‚ Detail: The states of the transition system for the Train have the following intuitive meaning: in state "far" the train is not close to the          â”‚            
           â”‚ crossing, in state "near" it is approaching the crossing and has just sent a signal to notify this, and in state "in" it is at the crossing. The      â”‚            
           â”‚ states "up" and "down" of the Gate have the obvious interpretation. The controller has 4 states 0, 1, 2 and 3. It changes from state 0 to 1 when the  â”‚            
           â”‚ train is approaching, from state 1 to 2 when the gate is lowering, from state 2 to 3 when the train is exiting the crossing, and from state 3 to 0    â”‚            
           â”‚ when the gate is raising. The state changes of the Controller stand for handshaking with the trains (via the actions approach and exit) and the Gate  â”‚

           â”‚ Gate when Train is Crossing**  [ \text{If } \text{train\_state} = \text{"in"}, \text{ then } \text{gate\_state} = \text{"down"} \]  - Explanation:    â”‚            
           â”‚ Ensures safety by guaranteeing that the gate is always down (closed) when the train is in the crossing (at the "in" state). 2. **Invariant 2:         â”‚            
           â”‚ Controller-Gate Consistency**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 2 \land \text{train\_state} = "in") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "down" \]  -           â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Ensures the controller is in the correct state to have closed the gate when the train is present at the crossing. This reflects correct  â”‚            
           â”‚ coordination between the controller and the gate. 3. **Invariant 3: Controller State for Raising Gate**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 3 \land        â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{train\_state} = "far") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "up" \]  - Explanation: Ensures that once the train has left the crossing and the          â”‚            
           â”‚ controller processes the exit, the gate should be or be in process to be raised. ## LTL Specifications LTL specifications provide statements related  â”‚            
           â”‚ to temporal behavior; they define how the system evolves over time: 1. **LTL Spec 1: Safety - Gate always closes before train enters**  [ G           â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow F (\text{gate\_state} = "down")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train is near (an approaching train    â”‚            
           â”‚ has been detected), it is eventually followed by the gate being down. This specification ensures the gate will always close before the train is in    â”‚            
           â”‚ the crossing area. 2. **LTL Spec 2: Liveness - Gates eventually open after train leaves**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "far" \rightarrow F             â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "up")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train state is "far" (has passed the crossing), it is eventually followed by the     â”‚            
           â”‚ gate raising. This ensures that the gate does not remain closed indefinitely after the train has passed. 3. **LTL Spec 3: Response - Train crossing   â”‚            
           â”‚ results in gate closure and reopening**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow (F (\text{gate\_state} = "down") \land F (\text{gate\_state} = â”‚            
           â”‚ "up"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that whenever the train approaches, the gate eventually goes down before the train arrives and also goes back up   â”‚            
           â”‚ after the train exits the crossing. This guarantees both safety (gate is down when train is in) and liveness (gate eventually reopens). 4. **LTL Spec â”‚            
           â”‚ 4: Fairness - If gate is raised, it must have been previously lowered for each approaching train**  [ G (\text{gate\_state} = "up" \rightarrow X (P   â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "down"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that if a gate is observed to be up, previously it must have been down. This prevents      â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the gate remains perpetually up even as trains pass through the crossing. These invariants and LTL specifications together ensure     â”‚

           â”‚ Gate when Train is Crossing**  [ \text{If } \text{train\_state} = \text{"in"}, \text{ then } \text{gate\_state} = \text{"down"} \]  - Explanation:    â”‚            
           â”‚ Ensures safety by guaranteeing that the gate is always down (closed) when the train is in the crossing (at the "in" state). 2. **Invariant 2:         â”‚            
           â”‚ Controller-Gate Consistency**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 2 \land \text{train\_state} = "in") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "down" \]  -           â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Ensures the controller is in the correct state to have closed the gate when the train is present at the crossing. This reflects correct  â”‚            
           â”‚ coordination between the controller and the gate. 3. **Invariant 3: Controller State for Raising Gate**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 3 \land        â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{train\_state} = "far") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "up" \]  - Explanation: Ensures that once the train has left the crossing and the          â”‚            
           â”‚ controller processes the exit, the gate should be or be in process to be raised. ## LTL Specifications LTL specifications provide statements related  â”‚            
           â”‚ to temporal behavior; they define how the system evolves over time: 1. **LTL Spec 1: Safety - Gate always closes before train enters**  [ G           â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow F (\text{gate\_state} = "down")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train is near (an approaching train    â”‚            
           â”‚ has been detected), it is eventually followed by the gate being down. This specification ensures the gate will always close before the train is in    â”‚            
           â”‚ the crossing area. 2. **LTL Spec 2: Liveness - Gates eventually open after train leaves**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "far" \rightarrow F             â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "up")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train state is "far" (has passed the crossing), it is eventually followed by the     â”‚            
           â”‚ gate raising. This ensures that the gate does not remain closed indefinitely after the train has passed. 3. **LTL Spec 3: Response - Train crossing   â”‚            
           â”‚ results in gate closure and reopening**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow (F (\text{gate\_state} = "down") \land F (\text{gate\_state} = â”‚            
           â”‚ "up"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that whenever the train approaches, the gate eventually goes down before the train arrives and also goes back up   â”‚            
           â”‚ after the train exits the crossing. This guarantees both safety (gate is down when train is in) and liveness (gate eventually reopens). 4. **LTL Spec â”‚            
           â”‚ 4: Fairness - If gate is raised, it must have been previously lowered for each approaching train**  [ G (\text{gate\_state} = "up" \rightarrow X (P   â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "down"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that if a gate is observed to be up, previously it must have been down. This prevents      â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the gate remains perpetually up even as trains pass through the crossing. These invariants and LTL specifications together ensure     â”‚            
           â”‚ that the railroad crossing control system operates safely and effectively, conforming to the essential safety requirements and operational            â”‚

           â”‚ Gate when Train is Crossing**  [ \text{If } \text{train\_state} = \text{"in"}, \text{ then } \text{gate\_state} = \text{"down"} \]  - Explanation:    â”‚            
           â”‚ Ensures safety by guaranteeing that the gate is always down (closed) when the train is in the crossing (at the "in" state). 2. **Invariant 2:         â”‚            
           â”‚ Controller-Gate Consistency**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 2 \land \text{train\_state} = "in") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "down" \]  -           â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Ensures the controller is in the correct state to have closed the gate when the train is present at the crossing. This reflects correct  â”‚            
           â”‚ coordination between the controller and the gate. 3. **Invariant 3: Controller State for Raising Gate**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 3 \land        â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{train\_state} = "far") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "up" \]  - Explanation: Ensures that once the train has left the crossing and the          â”‚            
           â”‚ controller processes the exit, the gate should be or be in process to be raised. ## LTL Specifications LTL specifications provide statements related  â”‚            
           â”‚ to temporal behavior; they define how the system evolves over time: 1. **LTL Spec 1: Safety - Gate always closes before train enters**  [ G           â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow F (\text{gate\_state} = "down")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train is near (an approaching train    â”‚            
           â”‚ has been detected), it is eventually followed by the gate being down. This specification ensures the gate will always close before the train is in    â”‚            
           â”‚ the crossing area. 2. **LTL Spec 2: Liveness - Gates eventually open after train leaves**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "far" \rightarrow F             â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "up")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train state is "far" (has passed the crossing), it is eventually followed by the     â”‚            
           â”‚ gate raising. This ensures that the gate does not remain closed indefinitely after the train has passed. 3. **LTL Spec 3: Response - Train crossing   â”‚            
           â”‚ results in gate closure and reopening**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow (F (\text{gate\_state} = "down") \land F (\text{gate\_state} = â”‚            
           â”‚ "up"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that whenever the train approaches, the gate eventually goes down before the train arrives and also goes back up   â”‚            
           â”‚ after the train exits the crossing. This guarantees both safety (gate is down when train is in) and liveness (gate eventually reopens). 4. **LTL Spec â”‚            
           â”‚ 4: Fairness - If gate is raised, it must have been previously lowered for each approaching train**  [ G (\text{gate\_state} = "up" \rightarrow X (P   â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "down"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that if a gate is observed to be up, previously it must have been down. This prevents      â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the gate remains perpetually up even as trains pass through the crossing. These invariants and LTL specifications together ensure     â”‚            
           â”‚ that the railroad crossing control system operates safely and effectively, conforming to the essential safety requirements and operational            â”‚

           â”‚ Gate when Train is Crossing**  [ \text{If } \text{train\_state} = \text{"in"}, \text{ then } \text{gate\_state} = \text{"down"} \]  - Explanation:    â”‚            
           â”‚ Ensures safety by guaranteeing that the gate is always down (closed) when the train is in the crossing (at the "in" state). 2. **Invariant 2:         â”‚            
           â”‚ Controller-Gate Consistency**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 2 \land \text{train\_state} = "in") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "down" \]  -           â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation: Ensures the controller is in the correct state to have closed the gate when the train is present at the crossing. This reflects correct  â”‚            
           â”‚ coordination between the controller and the gate. 3. **Invariant 3: Controller State for Raising Gate**  [ (\text{controller\_state} = 3 \land        â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{train\_state} = "far") \implies \text{gate\_state} = "up" \]  - Explanation: Ensures that once the train has left the crossing and the          â”‚            
           â”‚ controller processes the exit, the gate should be or be in process to be raised. ## LTL Specifications LTL specifications provide statements related  â”‚            
           â”‚ to temporal behavior; they define how the system evolves over time: 1. **LTL Spec 1: Safety - Gate always closes before train enters**  [ G           â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow F (\text{gate\_state} = "down")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train is near (an approaching train    â”‚            
           â”‚ has been detected), it is eventually followed by the gate being down. This specification ensures the gate will always close before the train is in    â”‚            
           â”‚ the crossing area. 2. **LTL Spec 2: Liveness - Gates eventually open after train leaves**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "far" \rightarrow F             â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "up")) \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the train state is "far" (has passed the crossing), it is eventually followed by the     â”‚            
           â”‚ gate raising. This ensures that the gate does not remain closed indefinitely after the train has passed. 3. **LTL Spec 3: Response - Train crossing   â”‚            
           â”‚ results in gate closure and reopening**  [ G (\text{train\_state} = "near" \rightarrow (F (\text{gate\_state} = "down") \land F (\text{gate\_state} = â”‚            
           â”‚ "up"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that whenever the train approaches, the gate eventually goes down before the train arrives and also goes back up   â”‚            
           â”‚ after the train exits the crossing. This guarantees both safety (gate is down when train is in) and liveness (gate eventually reopens). 4. **LTL Spec â”‚            
           â”‚ 4: Fairness - If gate is raised, it must have been previously lowered for each approaching train**  [ G (\text{gate\_state} = "up" \rightarrow X (P   â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{gate\_state} = "down"))) \]  - Explanation: Ensures that if a gate is observed to be up, previously it must have been down. This prevents      â”‚            
           â”‚ scenarios where the gate remains perpetually up even as trains pass through the crossing. These invariants and LTL specifications together ensure     â”‚            
           â”‚ that the railroad crossing control system operates safely and effectively, conforming to the essential safety requirements and operational            â”‚
