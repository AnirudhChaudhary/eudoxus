           â”‚ > Consider a system essentially consisting of a sender S and a receiver R that communicate with each other over channels c and d. The receiver sends  â”‚            
           â”‚ messages to the sender via channel d, and the sender sends messages to the receiver via channel c. It is assumed that both channels have an unlimited â”‚            
           â”‚ buffer. Channel c is unreliable in the sense that data may get lost when being transmitted from the sender S to channel c. Once messages are stored   â”‚            
           â”‚ in the buffer of channel c, they are neither corrupted nor lost. Channel d is assumed to be perfect. The goal is to design a communication protocol   â”‚            
           â”‚ that ensures any distinct transmitted datum by S to be delivered to R. To ensure this in the presence of possible message losses, sender S resorts to â”‚            
           â”‚ retransmissions. Messages are transmitted one by one, i.e., S starts sending a new message once the transmission of the previous message has been     â”‚            
           â”‚ successful. This is a simple flow control principle, known as "send-and-wait". Each message m from S is sent with a control bit b, and when R         â”‚            
           â”‚ receives this, it sends an acknowledgement consisting of the control bit it just received. On receipt of the acknowledgement, S sends a new message   â”‚            
           â”‚ with the negation of the control bit. If S has to wait too long for the acknowledgement, it times out and retransmits the original message and        â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit. Build a model of this system, using submodules for S and R. Use the variable names c, d, S, R, m and b.                                  â”‚

           â”‚ ensure the system behaves correctly according to the requirements. Here, we describe these specifications for the system. ### Invariants 1. **Channel â”‚            
           â”‚ Capacity**: \( \forall t, \text{size}(c_t) \geq 0 \land \text{size}(d_t) \geq 0 \)  - **Explanation**: At all times, the buffer sizes of channels c   â”‚            
           â”‚ and d are non-negative, reflecting the unlimited buffer capacity assumption. 2. **Buffer Integrity on c**: \( \forall m, b \mid \text{sent}(S, (m,    â”‚            
           â”‚ b)) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(c, (m, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Any message \( (m, b) \) sent by sender S is guaranteed to be present in channel   â”‚            
           â”‚ c's buffer at least until it might be lost (if ever), due to the unreliability of channel c. 3. **Buffer Integrity on d**: \( \forall b,              â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{received\_ack}(R, b) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(d, b) \)  - **Explanation**: Every acknowledgment \( b \) sent by receiver R must be in       â”‚            
           â”‚ channel d's buffer. Channel d is perfect, ensuring no loss or corruption. ### LTL Specifications 1. **Loss Resilience** \( G ( \text{sent}(S, (m, b)) â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F \text{received}(R, (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, eventually R should receive \( (m, â”‚            
           â”‚ b) \). This property ensures that despite possible losses in channel c, the message will be received eventually, considering retransmissions. 2.      â”‚            
           â”‚ **Acknowledgment Transmission** \( G (\text{received}(R, (m, b)) \rightarrow F \text{sent}(R, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if R receives a    â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \), it should eventually send an acknowledgment \( b \) through channel d. This occurs without loss in channel d. 3. **Correct      â”‚            
           â”‚ Acknowledgment Handling and Bit Alternation** \( G (\text{received\_ack}(S, b) \rightarrow X (\text{sent}(S, (m, \neg b)) \lor \text{timeout}(S))) \) â”‚            
           â”‚ - **Explanation**: Globally, if S receives an acknowledgment with bit \( b \), then in the next state, S should send a new message with the negated   â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit \( \neg b \) or should handle a timeout if the acknowledgment is delayed excessively. 4. **Non-Overlap of Transmissions** \( G            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{sent}(S, (m, b)) \rightarrow \neg (\text{sent}(S, (m', b')) \land m \neq m' \land b' \neq \neg b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a       â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, no other messages with different content or control bits, except as allowed by the protocol's bit negation         â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism, may be sent concurrently. This is key in the "send-and-wait" system model. 5. **Fairness of Transmission Attempts** \( G F (\text{sent}(S, â”‚            
           â”‚ (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, it is always the case that eventually, S will attempt to send each message \( (m, b) \). This property      â”‚            
           â”‚ assures that the sender does not stop attempting to send messages, respecting the need for retransmissions in case of message losses. These           â”‚            
           â”‚ invariants and LTL specifications structurally capture and enforce the desired behaviors in the described communication system, ensuring both its     â”‚            
           â”‚ functional correctness and adherence to the flow-control and reliability requirements.                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ ensure the system behaves correctly according to the requirements. Here, we describe these specifications for the system. ### Invariants 1. **Channel â”‚            
           â”‚ Capacity**: \( \forall t, \text{size}(c_t) \geq 0 \land \text{size}(d_t) \geq 0 \)  - **Explanation**: At all times, the buffer sizes of channels c   â”‚            
           â”‚ and d are non-negative, reflecting the unlimited buffer capacity assumption. 2. **Buffer Integrity on c**: \( \forall m, b \mid \text{sent}(S, (m,    â”‚            
           â”‚ b)) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(c, (m, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Any message \( (m, b) \) sent by sender S is guaranteed to be present in channel   â”‚            
           â”‚ c's buffer at least until it might be lost (if ever), due to the unreliability of channel c. 3. **Buffer Integrity on d**: \( \forall b,              â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{received\_ack}(R, b) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(d, b) \)  - **Explanation**: Every acknowledgment \( b \) sent by receiver R must be in       â”‚            
           â”‚ channel d's buffer. Channel d is perfect, ensuring no loss or corruption. ### LTL Specifications 1. **Loss Resilience** \( G ( \text{sent}(S, (m, b)) â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F \text{received}(R, (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, eventually R should receive \( (m, â”‚            
           â”‚ b) \). This property ensures that despite possible losses in channel c, the message will be received eventually, considering retransmissions. 2.      â”‚            
           â”‚ **Acknowledgment Transmission** \( G (\text{received}(R, (m, b)) \rightarrow F \text{sent}(R, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if R receives a    â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \), it should eventually send an acknowledgment \( b \) through channel d. This occurs without loss in channel d. 3. **Correct      â”‚            
           â”‚ Acknowledgment Handling and Bit Alternation** \( G (\text{received\_ack}(S, b) \rightarrow X (\text{sent}(S, (m, \neg b)) \lor \text{timeout}(S))) \) â”‚            
           â”‚ - **Explanation**: Globally, if S receives an acknowledgment with bit \( b \), then in the next state, S should send a new message with the negated   â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit \( \neg b \) or should handle a timeout if the acknowledgment is delayed excessively. 4. **Non-Overlap of Transmissions** \( G            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{sent}(S, (m, b)) \rightarrow \neg (\text{sent}(S, (m', b')) \land m \neq m' \land b' \neq \neg b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a       â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, no other messages with different content or control bits, except as allowed by the protocol's bit negation         â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism, may be sent concurrently. This is key in the "send-and-wait" system model. 5. **Fairness of Transmission Attempts** \( G F (\text{sent}(S, â”‚            
           â”‚ (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, it is always the case that eventually, S will attempt to send each message \( (m, b) \). This property      â”‚            
           â”‚ assures that the sender does not stop attempting to send messages, respecting the need for retransmissions in case of message losses. These           â”‚            
           â”‚ invariants and LTL specifications structurally capture and enforce the desired behaviors in the described communication system, ensuring both its     â”‚            
           â”‚ functional correctness and adherence to the flow-control and reliability requirements.                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ c's buffer at least until it might be lost (if ever), due to the unreliability of channel c. 3. **Buffer Integrity on d**: \( \forall b,              â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{received\_ack}(R, b) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(d, b) \)  - **Explanation**: Every acknowledgment \( b \) sent by receiver R must be in       â”‚            
           â”‚ channel d's buffer. Channel d is perfect, ensuring no loss or corruption. ### LTL Specifications 1. **Loss Resilience** \( G ( \text{sent}(S, (m, b)) â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F \text{received}(R, (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, eventually R should receive \( (m, â”‚            
           â”‚ b) \). This property ensures that despite possible losses in channel c, the message will be received eventually, considering retransmissions. 2.      â”‚            
           â”‚ **Acknowledgment Transmission** \( G (\text{received}(R, (m, b)) \rightarrow F \text{sent}(R, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if R receives a    â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \), it should eventually send an acknowledgment \( b \) through channel d. This occurs without loss in channel d. 3. **Correct      â”‚            
           â”‚ Acknowledgment Handling and Bit Alternation** \( G (\text{received\_ack}(S, b) \rightarrow X (\text{sent}(S, (m, \neg b)) \lor \text{timeout}(S))) \) â”‚            
           â”‚ - **Explanation**: Globally, if S receives an acknowledgment with bit \( b \), then in the next state, S should send a new message with the negated   â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit \( \neg b \) or should handle a timeout if the acknowledgment is delayed excessively. 4. **Non-Overlap of Transmissions** \( G            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{sent}(S, (m, b)) \rightarrow \neg (\text{sent}(S, (m', b')) \land m \neq m' \land b' \neq \neg b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a       â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, no other messages with different content or control bits, except as allowed by the protocol's bit negation         â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism, may be sent concurrently. This is key in the "send-and-wait" system model. 5. **Fairness of Transmission Attempts** \( G F (\text{sent}(S, â”‚            
           â”‚ (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, it is always the case that eventually, S will attempt to send each message \( (m, b) \). This property      â”‚            
           â”‚ assures that the sender does not stop attempting to send messages, respecting the need for retransmissions in case of message losses. These           â”‚            
           â”‚ invariants and LTL specifications structurally capture and enforce the desired behaviors in the described communication system, ensuring both its     â”‚

           â”‚ ensure the system behaves correctly according to the requirements. Here, we describe these specifications for the system. ### Invariants 1. **Channel â”‚            
           â”‚ Capacity**: \( \forall t, \text{size}(c_t) \geq 0 \land \text{size}(d_t) \geq 0 \)  - **Explanation**: At all times, the buffer sizes of channels c   â”‚            
           â”‚ and d are non-negative, reflecting the unlimited buffer capacity assumption. 2. **Buffer Integrity on c**: \( \forall m, b \mid \text{sent}(S, (m,    â”‚            
           â”‚ b)) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(c, (m, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Any message \( (m, b) \) sent by sender S is guaranteed to be present in channel   â”‚            
           â”‚ c's buffer at least until it might be lost (if ever), due to the unreliability of channel c. 3. **Buffer Integrity on d**: \( \forall b,              â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{received\_ack}(R, b) \rightarrow \text{exists in}(d, b) \)  - **Explanation**: Every acknowledgment \( b \) sent by receiver R must be in       â”‚            
           â”‚ channel d's buffer. Channel d is perfect, ensuring no loss or corruption. ### LTL Specifications 1. **Loss Resilience** \( G ( \text{sent}(S, (m, b)) â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F \text{received}(R, (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, eventually R should receive \( (m, â”‚            
           â”‚ b) \). This property ensures that despite possible losses in channel c, the message will be received eventually, considering retransmissions. 2.      â”‚            
           â”‚ **Acknowledgment Transmission** \( G (\text{received}(R, (m, b)) \rightarrow F \text{sent}(R, b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if R receives a    â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \), it should eventually send an acknowledgment \( b \) through channel d. This occurs without loss in channel d. 3. **Correct      â”‚            
           â”‚ Acknowledgment Handling and Bit Alternation** \( G (\text{received\_ack}(S, b) \rightarrow X (\text{sent}(S, (m, \neg b)) \lor \text{timeout}(S))) \) â”‚            
           â”‚ - **Explanation**: Globally, if S receives an acknowledgment with bit \( b \), then in the next state, S should send a new message with the negated   â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit \( \neg b \) or should handle a timeout if the acknowledgment is delayed excessively. 4. **Non-Overlap of Transmissions** \( G            â”‚            
           â”‚ (\text{sent}(S, (m, b)) \rightarrow \neg (\text{sent}(S, (m', b')) \land m \neq m' \land b' \neq \neg b)) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, if a       â”‚            
           â”‚ message \( (m, b) \) is sent by S, no other messages with different content or control bits, except as allowed by the protocol's bit negation         â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism, may be sent concurrently. This is key in the "send-and-wait" system model. 5. **Fairness of Transmission Attempts** \( G F (\text{sent}(S, â”‚            
           â”‚ (m, b))) \)  - **Explanation**: Globally, it is always the case that eventually, S will attempt to send each message \( (m, b) \). This property      â”‚            
           â”‚ assures that the sender does not stop attempting to send messages, respecting the need for retransmissions in case of message losses. These           â”‚
