           â”‚ > The alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a protocol for transmitting messages along a 'lossy line,' i.e., a line which may lose or duplicate messages. â”‚            
           â”‚ The protocol guarantees that, providing the line doesn't lose infinitely many messages, communication between the sender and the receiver will be     â”‚            
           â”‚ successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt messages; however, there is no way of guaranteeing successful    â”‚            
           â”‚ transmission along a line which can corrupt.) The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the receiver, the message     â”‚            
           â”‚ channel and the acknowledgement channel. The sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the      â”‚            
           â”‚ receiver receives a message with the control bit 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If and when the receiver receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel.  â”‚            
           â”‚ By alternating the control bit, both receiver and sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages (i.e., they ignore messages that  â”‚            
           â”‚ have the unexpected control bit). If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the              â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgement arrives. If the receiver doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement.    â”‚

           â”‚ successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt messages; however, there is no way of guaranteeing successful    â”‚            
           â”‚ transmission along a line which can corrupt.)                                                                                                         â”‚

           â”‚ The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the receiver, the message channel and the acknowledgement channel. The      â”‚            
           â”‚ sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the receiver receives a message with the control bit  â”‚            
           â”‚ 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If   â”‚            
           â”‚ and when the receiver receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel. By alternating the control bit, both receiver and â”‚            
           â”‚ sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages (i.e., they ignore messages that have the unexpected control bit).                  â”‚            
           â”‚ If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the acknowledgement arrives. If the receiver       â”‚            
           â”‚ doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement.                                             â”‚

           â”‚ (0 and 1).  - Waits for an acknowledgment of the transmitted message before sending the next message. 2. **Receiver (R)**:  - Receives messages and   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends acknowledgments.  - Checks the control bit to validate the received message. 3. **Message Channel (M)**:  - Transfers messages from Sender to   â”‚            
           â”‚ Receiver. Subject to losses and duplications. 4. **Acknowledgment Channel (A)**:  - Transfers acknowledgments from Receiver to Sender. Subject to     â”‚            
           â”‚ losses and duplications. #### System Variables: - **st**: The current control state (`0` or `1`) that the Sender uses to tag messages. -              â”‚            
           â”‚ **message1**: Represents the message being sent from Sender to Receiver, including its current control bit. - **message2**: Represents the message as â”‚            
           â”‚ it is received by the Receiver, potentially affected by losses or duplications. - **ack**: Acknowledgment sent by the Receiver, indicating the        â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit of the last correctly received message. ### Invariants: 1. **Sender Control Bit Consistency**:  [  \text{Invariant}_1: (st = \text{ack})  â”‚            
           â”‚ \lor (st \neq \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: The sender's control bit should always be in one of two states: either matching the received            â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgment (indicating the receipt of the previous message) or waiting to match (after a message resend). 2. **Message Control Bit Consistency**: â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{Invariant}_2: (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = st)  \]  - Explanation: The control bit of the message currently being sent should always match  â”‚            
           â”‚ the sender's current state control bit. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Message Acknowledgment Guarantee**:  [  \text{LTL}_1: \Box (\text{message1}      â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \Diamond \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is sent (`message1`), it is eventually acknowledged (`ack`), assuming no  â”‚            
           â”‚ infinite losses. 2. **Alternating Control Bits**:  [  \text{LTL}_2: \Box ( \text{ack} = 0 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 1) )  \] â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{LTL}_3: \Box ( \text{ack} = 1 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 0) )  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is          â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledged with bit 0, the next message sent must have control bit 1, and vice versa. This ensures the alternation of control bits, a core          â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism of ABP to manage duplications and message loss. 3. **No Stale Messages**:  [  \text{LTL}_4: \Box (\text{message2}.\text{bit} \neq st        â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \bigcirc \neg \text{message2})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the receiver receives a message with a control bit (`message2.bit`) that  â”‚            
           â”‚ does not match the expected current bit (`st` of the sender), such messages should not influence future states (`neg message2` in the next state),    â”‚            
           â”‚ resolving issues from duplicated or outdated messages. ### Conclusion This model, invariants, and LTL specifications encapsulate key properties of    â”‚            
           â”‚ the alternating bit protocol in handling message duplication, loss, and ordering on a lossy transmission line. Each component is designed to work     â”‚            
           â”‚ collaboratively to ensure the reliability and correctness of data transmission even in the presence of faults.                                        â”‚

           â”‚ (0 and 1).  - Waits for an acknowledgment of the transmitted message before sending the next message. 2. **Receiver (R)**:  - Receives messages and   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends acknowledgments.  - Checks the control bit to validate the received message. 3. **Message Channel (M)**:  - Transfers messages from Sender to   â”‚            
           â”‚ Receiver. Subject to losses and duplications. 4. **Acknowledgment Channel (A)**:  - Transfers acknowledgments from Receiver to Sender. Subject to     â”‚            
           â”‚ losses and duplications. #### System Variables: - **st**: The current control state (`0` or `1`) that the Sender uses to tag messages. -              â”‚            
           â”‚ **message1**: Represents the message being sent from Sender to Receiver, including its current control bit. - **message2**: Represents the message as â”‚            
           â”‚ it is received by the Receiver, potentially affected by losses or duplications. - **ack**: Acknowledgment sent by the Receiver, indicating the        â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit of the last correctly received message. ### Invariants: 1. **Sender Control Bit Consistency**:  [  \text{Invariant}_1: (st = \text{ack})  â”‚            
           â”‚ \lor (st \neq \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: The sender's control bit should always be in one of two states: either matching the received            â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgment (indicating the receipt of the previous message) or waiting to match (after a message resend). 2. **Message Control Bit Consistency**: â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{Invariant}_2: (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = st)  \]  - Explanation: The control bit of the message currently being sent should always match  â”‚            
           â”‚ the sender's current state control bit. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Message Acknowledgment Guarantee**:  [  \text{LTL}_1: \Box (\text{message1}      â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \Diamond \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is sent (`message1`), it is eventually acknowledged (`ack`), assuming no  â”‚            
           â”‚ infinite losses. 2. **Alternating Control Bits**:  [  \text{LTL}_2: \Box ( \text{ack} = 0 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 1) )  \] â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{LTL}_3: \Box ( \text{ack} = 1 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 0) )  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is          â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledged with bit 0, the next message sent must have control bit 1, and vice versa. This ensures the alternation of control bits, a core          â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism of ABP to manage duplications and message loss. 3. **No Stale Messages**:  [  \text{LTL}_4: \Box (\text{message2}.\text{bit} \neq st        â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \bigcirc \neg \text{message2})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the receiver receives a message with a control bit (`message2.bit`) that  â”‚            
           â”‚ does not match the expected current bit (`st` of the sender), such messages should not influence future states (`neg message2` in the next state),    â”‚            
           â”‚ resolving issues from duplicated or outdated messages. ### Conclusion This model, invariants, and LTL specifications encapsulate key properties of    â”‚

           â”‚ is defined as a Boolean but not clearly influencing how messages are represented or controlled, there remains ambiguity - are the messages            â”‚            
           â”‚ `True`/`False` or `UNKNOWN` significant?                                                                                                              â”‚

           â”‚ possibly starting with one bit (0 or 1) instead of `UNKNOWN` for precise state representation.                                                        â”‚

           â”‚ - **Analysis**: According to the invariant, `(st = ack) âˆ¨ (st â‰  ack)`, this is always true irrespective of the system's state. However, the model     â”‚            
           â”‚ uses `st` as a Boolean (`True`/`False`), and does not directly translate to a bit system unless interpreted as `0` or `1`. `ack` is also a boolean    â”‚            
           â”‚ and similarly does not directly correlate to the alternation pattern described.                                                                       â”‚

           â”‚ (0 and 1).  - Waits for an acknowledgment of the transmitted message before sending the next message. 2. **Receiver (R)**:  - Receives messages and   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends acknowledgments.  - Checks the control bit to validate the received message. 3. **Message Channel (M)**:  - Transfers messages from Sender to   â”‚            
           â”‚ Receiver. Subject to losses and duplications. 4. **Acknowledgment Channel (A)**:  - Transfers acknowledgments from Receiver to Sender. Subject to     â”‚            
           â”‚ losses and duplications. #### System Variables: - **st**: The current control state (`0` or `1`) that the Sender uses to tag messages. -              â”‚            
           â”‚ **message1**: Represents the message being sent from Sender to Receiver, including its current control bit. - **message2**: Represents the message as â”‚            
           â”‚ it is received by the Receiver, potentially affected by losses or duplications. - **ack**: Acknowledgment sent by the Receiver, indicating the        â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit of the last correctly received message. ### Invariants: 1. **Sender Control Bit Consistency**:  [  \text{Invariant}_1: (st = \text{ack})  â”‚            
           â”‚ \lor (st \neq \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: The sender's control bit should always be in one of two states: either matching the received            â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgment (indicating the receipt of the previous message) or waiting to match (after a message resend). 2. **Message Control Bit Consistency**: â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{Invariant}_2: (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = st)  \]  - Explanation: The control bit of the message currently being sent should always match  â”‚            
           â”‚ the sender's current state control bit. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Message Acknowledgment Guarantee**:  [  \text{LTL}_1: \Box (\text{message1}      â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \Diamond \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is sent (`message1`), it is eventually acknowledged (`ack`), assuming no  â”‚            
           â”‚ infinite losses. 2. **Alternating Control Bits**:  [  \text{LTL}_2: \Box ( \text{ack} = 0 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 1) )  \] â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{LTL}_3: \Box ( \text{ack} = 1 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 0) )  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is          â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledged with bit 0, the next message sent must have control bit 1, and vice versa. This ensures the alternation of control bits, a core          â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism of ABP to manage duplications and message loss. 3. **No Stale Messages**:  [  \text{LTL}_4: \Box (\text{message2}.\text{bit} \neq st        â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \bigcirc \neg \text{message2})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the receiver receives a message with a control bit (`message2.bit`) that  â”‚            
           â”‚ does not match the expected current bit (`st` of the sender), such messages should not influence future states (`neg message2` in the next state),    â”‚            
           â”‚ resolving issues from duplicated or outdated messages. ### Conclusion This model, invariants, and LTL specifications encapsulate key properties of    â”‚            
           â”‚ the alternating bit protocol in handling message duplication, loss, and ordering on a lossy transmission line. Each component is designed to work     â”‚            
           â”‚ collaboratively to ensure the reliability and correctness of data transmission even in the presence of faults.                                        â”‚

           â”‚ (0 and 1).  - Waits for an acknowledgment of the transmitted message before sending the next message. 2. **Receiver (R)**:  - Receives messages and   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends acknowledgments.  - Checks the control bit to validate the received message. 3. **Message Channel (M)**:  - Transfers messages from Sender to   â”‚            
           â”‚ Receiver. Subject to losses and duplications. 4. **Acknowledgment Channel (A)**:  - Transfers acknowledgments from Receiver to Sender. Subject to     â”‚            
           â”‚ losses and duplications. #### System Variables: - **st**: The current control state (`0` or `1`) that the Sender uses to tag messages. -              â”‚            
           â”‚ **message1**: Represents the message being sent from Sender to Receiver, including its current control bit. - **message2**: Represents the message as â”‚            
           â”‚ it is received by the Receiver, potentially affected by losses or duplications. - **ack**: Acknowledgment sent by the Receiver, indicating the        â”‚            
           â”‚ control bit of the last correctly received message. ### Invariants: 1. **Sender Control Bit Consistency**:  [  \text{Invariant}_1: (st = \text{ack})  â”‚            
           â”‚ \lor (st \neq \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: The sender's control bit should always be in one of two states: either matching the received            â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgment (indicating the receipt of the previous message) or waiting to match (after a message resend). 2. **Message Control Bit Consistency**: â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{Invariant}_2: (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = st)  \]  - Explanation: The control bit of the message currently being sent should always match  â”‚            
           â”‚ the sender's current state control bit. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Message Acknowledgment Guarantee**:  [  \text{LTL}_1: \Box (\text{message1}      â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \Diamond \text{ack})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is sent (`message1`), it is eventually acknowledged (`ack`), assuming no  â”‚            
           â”‚ infinite losses. 2. **Alternating Control Bits**:  [  \text{LTL}_2: \Box ( \text{ack} = 0 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 1) )  \] â”‚            
           â”‚ [  \text{LTL}_3: \Box ( \text{ack} = 1 \rightarrow \bigcirc (\text{message1}.\text{bit} = 0) )  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if a message is          â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledged with bit 0, the next message sent must have control bit 1, and vice versa. This ensures the alternation of control bits, a core          â”‚            
           â”‚ mechanism of ABP to manage duplications and message loss. 3. **No Stale Messages**:  [  \text{LTL}_4: \Box (\text{message2}.\text{bit} \neq st        â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow \bigcirc \neg \text{message2})  \]  - Explanation: Globally, if the receiver receives a message with a control bit (`message2.bit`) that  â”‚            
           â”‚ does not match the expected current bit (`st` of the sender), such messages should not influence future states (`neg message2` in the next state),    â”‚            
           â”‚ resolving issues from duplicated or outdated messages. ### Conclusion This model, invariants, and LTL specifications encapsulate key properties of    â”‚

           â”‚ limited to two states and does not hold the value explicitly as 0 or 1.                                                                               â”‚

           â”‚ The system moves between states based on acknowledgments and changes the state variable `st` accordingly. However, the properties relating to the     â”‚
