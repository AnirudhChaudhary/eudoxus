           â”‚ process cyclically executes \( x := x + 1 \) ten times, certain values of \( x \) (`1` to `10` times the number of active and correctly synchronized  â”‚            
           â”‚ processes) are feasible. However, obtaining exactly \( x = 2 \) at termination is impossible when all three processes run to completion (minimum \( x â”‚            
           â”‚ \) at termination is 3, one increment from each). The system, therefore, does not have an execution trace that warrants \( x = 2 \) under an          â”‚            
           â”‚ assumption that each process always completes its increment sequence without interruption. This LTL specification asserts that in all fair traces, \( â”‚            
           â”‚ x = 2 \) scenario does not happen at any point of halting the system. 2. **Reachability of x=30**: \( F (x = 30) \)  - *Explanation*: For x to reach  â”‚            
           â”‚ 30, all processes must execute all their respective increments without any failed or halted actions. This property expresses if it is feasible (not   â”‚

           â”‚ specification ensures that at no point in any execution will \( x \) exceed 30, based on the described operations in the programs of each process.    â”‚

           â”‚ asserts reaching 2 is impossible on termination, and while that might hold under certain multiprocessing assumptions, the given model context does    â”‚

           â”‚ 1. **Non-negative Variable**: \( x \geq 0 \)  - *Explanation*: Since \( x \) is initialized to 0 and is only incremented, \( x \) will never be       â”‚

           â”‚ increments \( x \) from 0 to 10, and there are three processes running in parallel without any decrement operations, \( x \) cannot exceed 30. ###    â”‚

           â”‚ process cyclically executes \( x := x + 1 \) ten times, certain values of \( x \) (`1` to `10` times the number of active and correctly synchronized  â”‚            
           â”‚ processes) are feasible. However, obtaining exactly \( x = 2 \) at termination is impossible when all three processes run to completion (minimum \( x â”‚            
           â”‚ \) at termination is 3, one increment from each). The system, therefore, does not have an execution trace that warrants \( x = 2 \) under an          â”‚

           â”‚ x = 2 \) scenario does not happen at any point of halting the system. 2. **Reachability of x=30**: \( F (x = 30) \)  - *Explanation*: For x to reach  â”‚            
           â”‚ 30, all processes must execute all their respective increments without any failed or halted actions. This property expresses if it is feasible (not   â”‚

           â”‚ Make sure that your code extends the `Module` class below and that it satisfies the following properties.                                             â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ > Given the system description, let's model the interactions between the processes \( P_1, P_2, \) and \( P_3 \) on the shared variable \( x \). Each â”‚            
           â”‚ process increments \( x \) by 1 in a sequence of three operations (LOAD, INC, STORE), which collectively represent the operation \( x := x + 1 \).    â”‚            
           â”‚ These processes are executed concurrently, which means race conditions and access conflicts to the shared variable \( x \) can occur. ### Invariants: â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Non-negative Variable**: \( x \geq 0 \)  - *Explanation*: Since \( x \) is initialized to 0 and is only incremented, \( x \) will never be       â”‚            
           â”‚ negative. This invariant holds across all possible states of the system. 2. **Bound on x**: \( x \leq 30 \)  - *Explanation*: Since each process      â”‚            
           â”‚ increments \( x \) from 0 to 10, and there are three processes running in parallel without any decrement operations, \( x \) cannot exceed 30. ###    â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL Specifications: 1. **Termination at x = 2 Is Not Possible in Fair Execution**: \( \lnot F (x = 2) \)  - *Explanation*: In the model where each    â”‚            
           â”‚ process cyclically executes \( x := x + 1 \) ten times, certain values of \( x \) (`1` to `10` times the number of active and correctly synchronized  â”‚            
           â”‚ processes) are feasible. However, obtaining exactly \( x = 2 \) at termination is impossible when all three processes run to completion (minimum \( x â”‚            
           â”‚ \) at termination is 3, one increment from each). The system, therefore, does not have an execution trace that warrants \( x = 2 \) under an          â”‚            
           â”‚ assumption that each process always completes its increment sequence without interruption. This LTL specification asserts that in all fair traces, \( â”‚            
           â”‚ x = 2 \) scenario does not happen at any point of halting the system. 2. **Reachability of x=30**: \( F (x = 30) \)  - *Explanation*: For x to reach  â”‚            
           â”‚ 30, all processes must execute all their respective increments without any failed or halted actions. This property expresses if it is feasible (not   â”‚            
           â”‚ necessarily always true) that \( x \) may eventually reach 30. 3. **Safety - No Overshoot**: \( G (x \leq 30) \)  - *Explanation*: This LTL           â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that at no point in any execution will \( x \) exceed 30, based on the described operations in the programs of each process.    â”‚            
           â”‚ ### Summary - The proposed invariants confirm and ensure non-negative and bounded values for \( x \). - The LTL specifications describe temporal      â”‚

           â”‚ > Given the system description, let's model the interactions between the processes \( P_1, P_2, \) and \( P_3 \) on the shared variable \( x \). Each â”‚            
           â”‚ process increments \( x \) by 1 in a sequence of three operations (LOAD, INC, STORE), which collectively represent the operation \( x := x + 1 \).    â”‚            
           â”‚ These processes are executed concurrently, which means race conditions and access conflicts to the shared variable \( x \) can occur. ### Invariants: â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Non-negative Variable**: \( x \geq 0 \)  - *Explanation*: Since \( x \) is initialized to 0 and is only incremented, \( x \) will never be       â”‚            
           â”‚ negative. This invariant holds across all possible states of the system. 2. **Bound on x**: \( x \leq 30 \)  - *Explanation*: Since each process      â”‚            
           â”‚ increments \( x \) from 0 to 10, and there are three processes running in parallel without any decrement operations, \( x \) cannot exceed 30. ###    â”‚            
           â”‚ LTL Specifications: 1. **Termination at x = 2 Is Not Possible in Fair Execution**: \( \lnot F (x = 2) \)  - *Explanation*: In the model where each    â”‚            
           â”‚ process cyclically executes \( x := x + 1 \) ten times, certain values of \( x \) (`1` to `10` times the number of active and correctly synchronized  â”‚            
           â”‚ processes) are feasible. However, obtaining exactly \( x = 2 \) at termination is impossible when all three processes run to completion (minimum \( x â”‚            
           â”‚ \) at termination is 3, one increment from each). The system, therefore, does not have an execution trace that warrants \( x = 2 \) under an          â”‚            
           â”‚ assumption that each process always completes its increment sequence without interruption. This LTL specification asserts that in all fair traces, \( â”‚            
           â”‚ x = 2 \) scenario does not happen at any point of halting the system. 2. **Reachability of x=30**: \( F (x = 30) \)  - *Explanation*: For x to reach  â”‚            
           â”‚ 30, all processes must execute all their respective increments without any failed or halted actions. This property expresses if it is feasible (not   â”‚            
           â”‚ necessarily always true) that \( x \) may eventually reach 30. 3. **Safety - No Overshoot**: \( G (x \leq 30) \)  - *Explanation*: This LTL           â”‚            
           â”‚ specification ensures that at no point in any execution will \( x \) exceed 30, based on the described operations in the programs of each process.    â”‚
