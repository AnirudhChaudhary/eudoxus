           â”‚ 2. **Stability Below Threshold:** When the temperature is below or equal to the threshold, the counter should not increment.                          â”‚            
           â”‚    - **Invariant:** (temp â‰¤ threshold) â†’ (count' = count)                                                                                             â”‚

           â”‚ (`threshold`), we can characterize the systemâ€™s behavior and requirements through invariants and LTL specifications. Let's break down the system      â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements and thus derive the invariants and LTL expressions: ### Invariants: 1. **Non-negative Count:** The counter value (`count`) must always   â”‚            
           â”‚ be non-negative since it represents the number of occurrences.  - **Invariant:** count â‰¥ 0  - **Explanation:** This invariant ensures that the        â”‚            
           â”‚ counter maintains a realistic count, as negative occurrences are not possible. 2. **Stability Below Threshold:** When the temperature is below or     â”‚            
           â”‚ equal to the threshold, the counter should not increment.  - **Invariant:** (temp â‰¤ threshold) â†’ (count' = count)  - **Explanation:** This asserts    â”‚            
           â”‚ that any time `temp` does not exceed `threshold`, the value of `count` in the next state (denoted as `count'`) must equal the current state `count`,  â”‚            
           â”‚ indicating no increment. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Safety Property - No Decrease in Count:** The count should not decrease at any point in time.   â”‚            
           â”‚ - **LTL:** G (count' â‰¥ count)  - **Explanation:** The globally operator (G) is used to specify that throughout the system execution, the value of the â”‚            
           â”‚ counter in the subsequent state must always be equal to or greater than the current state. This ensures that the system accurately logs all           â”‚            
           â”‚ occurrences without losing data. 2. **Eventual Counting Above Threshold:** Whenever the temperature exceeds the threshold, eventually the counter     â”‚            
           â”‚ must increase.  - **LTL:** G (temp > threshold -> F (count' > count))  - **Explanation:** This specification ensures that each time the temperature   â”‚            
           â”‚ is above the threshold, it will eventually lead to an increment of the `count` variable in some future state. The Future operator (F) is used to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify this eventual increment after the condition is met. 3. **Response Property - Immediate Increment on Threshold Breach:** If the temperature    â”‚            
           â”‚ exceeds the threshold, the counter must increment in the next state.  - **LTL:** G (temp > threshold -> X (count' = count + 1))  - **Explanation:**   â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that immediately following any instance where `temp` exceeds `threshold`, there is a corresponding and immediate increment in `count` by â”‚            
           â”‚ exactly one. The Next-time operator (X) indicates that this increment happens in the state immediately following the threshold breach. These          â”‚            
           â”‚ invariants and LTL specifications model key aspects and desired behaviors of the event counter system within the weather station, ensuring both       â”‚            
           â”‚ accurate data representation and correct system functionality over time.                                                                              â”‚

           â”‚ (`threshold`), we can characterize the systemâ€™s behavior and requirements through invariants and LTL specifications. Let's break down the system      â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements and thus derive the invariants and LTL expressions: ### Invariants: 1. **Non-negative Count:** The counter value (`count`) must always   â”‚            
           â”‚ be non-negative since it represents the number of occurrences.  - **Invariant:** count â‰¥ 0  - **Explanation:** This invariant ensures that the        â”‚            
           â”‚ counter maintains a realistic count, as negative occurrences are not possible. 2. **Stability Below Threshold:** When the temperature is below or     â”‚            
           â”‚ equal to the threshold, the counter should not increment.  - **Invariant:** (temp â‰¤ threshold) â†’ (count' = count)  - **Explanation:** This asserts    â”‚            
           â”‚ that any time `temp` does not exceed `threshold`, the value of `count` in the next state (denoted as `count'`) must equal the current state `count`,  â”‚            
           â”‚ indicating no increment. ### LTL Specifications: 1. **Safety Property - No Decrease in Count:** The count should not decrease at any point in time.   â”‚            
           â”‚ - **LTL:** G (count' â‰¥ count)  - **Explanation:** The globally operator (G) is used to specify that throughout the system execution, the value of the â”‚            
           â”‚ counter in the subsequent state must always be equal to or greater than the current state. This ensures that the system accurately logs all           â”‚            
           â”‚ occurrences without losing data. 2. **Eventual Counting Above Threshold:** Whenever the temperature exceeds the threshold, eventually the counter     â”‚            
           â”‚ must increase.  - **LTL:** G (temp > threshold -> F (count' > count))  - **Explanation:** This specification ensures that each time the temperature   â”‚            
           â”‚ is above the threshold, it will eventually lead to an increment of the `count` variable in some future state. The Future operator (F) is used to      â”‚            
           â”‚ specify this eventual increment after the condition is met. 3. **Response Property - Immediate Increment on Threshold Breach:** If the temperature    â”‚            
           â”‚ exceeds the threshold, the counter must increment in the next state.  - **LTL:** G (temp > threshold -> X (count' = count + 1))  - **Explanation:**   â”‚            
           â”‚ This ensures that immediately following any instance where `temp` exceeds `threshold`, there is a corresponding and immediate increment in `count` by â”‚            
           â”‚ exactly one. The Next-time operator (X) indicates that this increment happens in the state immediately following the threshold breach. These          â”‚            
           â”‚ invariants and LTL specifications model key aspects and desired behaviors of the event counter system within the weather station, ensuring both       â”‚
