           â”‚ > Based on the grading feedback, here are some specific changes and additions that can be made to improve the Python model: 1. Modify the `init`      â”‚            
           â”‚ function to set initial values for `heatOn` and `heatOff`: ```python def init(self):   self.heatOn = 0   self.heatOff = 0 ``` 2. Update the `next`    â”‚            
           â”‚ function to include conditions to check and maintain the temperature constraints specified: ```python def next(self):   if self.temp > 22:            â”‚            
           â”‚ self.heatOn = 1     self.heatOff = 0   elif self.temp < 18:     self.heatOn = 0     self.heatOff = 1   else:     self.heatOn = 0     self.heatOff = 0 â”‚            
           â”‚ ``` 3. Include conditions to check if the heater is eventually turned off after being turned on, and vice versa (consider using additional variables  â”‚            
           â”‚ to track the state of the heater): ```python class Thermostat(Module):   def types(self):     self.Bit = int   def inputs(self):     self.temp =      â”‚

           â”‚ self.heatOn = 0       self.heatOff = 0 ``` By incorporating these changes, the model should align more closely with the specified constraints and     â”‚

           â”‚ Based on the grading feedback provided, here are some specific suggestions to improve the Python model of the thermostat:                             â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Hysteresis Implementation**:                                                                                                                     â”‚            
           â”‚    - Adjust the logic for setting `heatOn` and `heatOff` to incorporate hysteresis. Update the conditions to consider the setpoint of 20 degrees      â”‚            
           â”‚ Celsius and the specified hysteresis range (2 degrees for heating and 2 degrees for cooling).                                                         â”‚            
           â”‚    - For example, modify the logic to set `heatOn` when `temp > 22.0` and set `heatOff` only if `temp < 18.0`, taking into account the hysteresis     â”‚            
           â”‚ range around the setpoint.                                                                                                                            â”‚

           â”‚    - Introduce feedback loops or calculations that simulate the heating and cooling process to ensure that future temperature behavior aligns with    â”‚            
           â”‚ the desired properties.                                                                                                                               â”‚

           â”‚    - Implement control mechanisms that ensure toggling between heating and cooling states based on the temperature conditions and hysteresis          â”‚            
           â”‚ requirements. This could involve maintaining a state variable to track the current mode of operation (heating or cooling).                            â”‚            
           â”‚    - Consider adding additional conditions or states to enforce cycling between heatOn and heatOff states to prevent continuous operation of the      â”‚            
           â”‚ heater.                                                                                                                                               â”‚

           â”‚ 4. **Refine LTL Specifications**:                                                                                                                     â”‚            
           â”‚    - Revise the LTL specifications to align with the updated model that incorporates hysteresis, future temperature predictions, and cycle            â”‚

           â”‚ Implementation**:  - Adjust the logic for setting `heatOn` and `heatOff` to incorporate hysteresis. Update the conditions to consider the setpoint of â”‚            
           â”‚ 20 degrees Celsius and the specified hysteresis range (2 degrees for heating and 2 degrees for cooling).  - For example, modify the logic to set      â”‚            
           â”‚ `heatOn` when `temp > 22.0` and set `heatOff` only if `temp < 18.0`, taking into account the hysteresis range around the setpoint. 2. **Future        â”‚            
           â”‚ Temperature Predictions**:  - Include mechanisms in the model to influence future temperature predictions based on the current state. This could      â”‚            
           â”‚ involve modeling the effect of heating or cooling actions on the temperature over time.  - Introduce feedback loops or calculations that simulate the â”‚            
           â”‚ heating and cooling process to ensure that future temperature behavior aligns with the desired properties. 3. **Cycle Guarantees**:  - Implement      â”‚            
           â”‚ control mechanisms that ensure toggling between heating and cooling states based on the temperature conditions and hysteresis requirements. This      â”‚            
           â”‚ could involve maintaining a state variable to track the current mode of operation (heating or cooling).  - Consider adding additional conditions or   â”‚            
           â”‚ states to enforce cycling between heatOn and heatOff states to prevent continuous operation of the heater. 4. **Refine LTL Specifications**:  -       â”‚            
           â”‚ Revise the LTL specifications to align with the updated model that incorporates hysteresis, future temperature predictions, and cycle guarantees.  -  â”‚            
           â”‚ Ensure that the model satisfies the specified LTL properties by verifying that the system behavior conforms to the desired control and response       â”‚            
           â”‚ patterns. 5. **Variable Naming**:  - Ensure consistency in variable names as per the natural language description. Update the variable names to match â”‚            
           â”‚ the given names - `temp`, `heatOn`, and `heatOff`. By incorporating these suggestions into the Python model, you can enhance its alignment with the   â”‚            
           â”‚ original description, improve semantic accuracy, and address the deficiencies highlighted in the grading feedback.                                    â”‚
