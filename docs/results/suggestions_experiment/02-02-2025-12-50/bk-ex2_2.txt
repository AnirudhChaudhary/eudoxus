           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. Define the states explicitly:                                                                                                                      â”‚            
           â”‚    - Update the `locals()` method to explicitly define the states as required by the first invariant. Modify it to: `self.state = Enum("pay",         â”‚            
           â”‚ "select", "soda", "beer")`.                                                                                                                           â”‚

           â”‚    - In the `next()` method, utilize the `coin_inserted` variable to track whether a coin has been inserted before delivering a drink. For example,   â”‚            
           â”‚ set `self.coin_inserted = True` when a coin is inserted.                                                                                              â”‚            
           â”‚    - Update the delivery logic in the `next()` method to include conditions based on the `coin_inserted` variable. For example, in the `if            â”‚            
           â”‚ (self.state == "select"):` block, check if `self.coin_inserted` is `True` before setting `self.drink_delivered` to `True`.                            â”‚

           â”‚    - In the `init()` method, provide an initial value for `coin_inserted`. Set it to `False` initially: `self.coin_inserted = False`.                 â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ 4. Complete the `specification()` method:                                                                                                             â”‚            
           â”‚    - In the `specification()` method, write an LTL property that checks that the vending machine only delivers a drink after being provided with a    â”‚            
           â”‚ coin. You can introduce auxiliary variables if needed to achieve this. Ensure the LTL property is correctly formulated and aligns with the expected   â”‚            
           â”‚ behavior.                                                                                                                                             â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ By implementing these changes, the Python model of the beverage vending machine will address the issues highlighted in the grading feedback and       â”‚

           â”‚ invariant. Modify it to: `self.state = Enum("pay", "select", "soda", "beer")`. 2. Utilize the private variables `coin_inserted` and                   â”‚            
           â”‚ `drink_delivered`:  - In the `next()` method, utilize the `coin_inserted` variable to track whether a coin has been inserted before delivering a      â”‚            
           â”‚ drink. For example, set `self.coin_inserted = True` when a coin is inserted.  - Update the delivery logic in the `next()` method to include           â”‚            
           â”‚ conditions based on the `coin_inserted` variable. For example, in the `if (self.state == "select"):` block, check if `self.coin_inserted` is `True`   â”‚            
           â”‚ before setting `self.drink_delivered` to `True`. 3. Provide an initial value for `coin_inserted`:  - In the `init()` method, provide an initial value â”‚            
           â”‚ for `coin_inserted`. Set it to `False` initially: `self.coin_inserted = False`. 4. Complete the `specification()` method:  - In the `specification()` â”‚            
           â”‚ method, write an LTL property that checks that the vending machine only delivers a drink after being provided with a coin. You can introduce          â”‚            
           â”‚ auxiliary variables if needed to achieve this. Ensure the LTL property is correctly formulated and aligns with the expected behavior. By implementing â”‚

           â”‚ specifically and does not handle the actual delivery transition based on the specific drink selected. Additionally, the model lacks a mechanism to    â”‚

           â”‚ and improvements can be implemented: 1. State Transitions:  - Add specific state transitions for selecting soda and beer. Modify the `next` function  â”‚            
           â”‚ to include distinct paths for transitioning based on the selected drink.  - Update the state transitions for "select" state to differentiate between  â”‚            
           â”‚ selecting soda and beer. This will ensure that the model accurately reflects the choices made by the user. 2. Drink Delivery Logic:  - Introduce      â”‚            
           â”‚ separate boolean variables to track the delivery status of soda and beer. This will allow for individual tracking of each drink's delivery.  - Modify â”‚            
           â”‚ the logic in the `next` function to ensure that the delivery of the selected drink (soda or beer) only occurs when the corresponding drink is chosen  â”‚            
           â”‚ and a coin is inserted. 3. LTL Property Satisfaction:  - Update the `specification` function to include conditions that ensure the delivery of the    â”‚            
           â”‚ selected drink (soda or beer) based on the LTL property provided.  - Implement mechanisms to enforce the LTL property requirement that guarantees the â”‚            
           â”‚ eventual delivery of the chosen drink after a coin is inserted and a selection is made. By incorporating these changes, the model will more           â”‚            
           â”‚ accurately reflect the behavior of a beverage vending machine, ensuring that the user's selections are properly handled, and the delivery of the      â”‚            
           â”‚ chosen drink is correctly executed. This will lead to a more comprehensive and effective formal model that adheres to the specified properties and    â”‚
