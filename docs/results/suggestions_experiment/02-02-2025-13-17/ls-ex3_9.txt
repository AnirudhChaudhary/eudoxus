           â”‚ 1. Add missing logic to ensure that the green state has persisted for at least 60 seconds before transitioning to yellow:                             â”‚            
           â”‚    - In the `if (self.state == "GREEN")` block, add an additional check to track the duration in the green state before transitioning to yellow. This â”‚            
           â”‚ can be done by introducing a new variable `green_duration` and updating the logic to increment it along with the count.                               â”‚

           â”‚ 2. Guarantee the eventual transition from green to yellow when a pedestrian is present:                                                               â”‚            
           â”‚    - In the existing logic for transitioning from green to yellow, ensure that the transition occurs when a pedestrian is present, regardless of the  â”‚            
           â”‚ duration in the green state. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional statements to prioritize the pedestrian presence over the time         â”‚            
           â”‚ criteria.                                                                                                                                             â”‚

           â”‚ 3. Explicitly consider the regular occurrence of the red state after each cycle of 60 seconds to address the fairness specification:                  â”‚            
           â”‚    - Introduce a new state or logic to handle the pending state after 60 seconds of being in the red state. This will ensure that the traffic light   â”‚            
           â”‚ system consistently cycles from red to green and back to red after completing each 60-second interval.                                                â”‚

           â”‚ > Based on the grading feedback, here are specific changes that can be made to improve the Python model of the traffic light system: 1. Add missing   â”‚            
           â”‚ logic to ensure that the green state has persisted for at least 60 seconds before transitioning to yellow:  - In the `if (self.state == "GREEN")`     â”‚            
           â”‚ block, add an additional check to track the duration in the green state before transitioning to yellow. This can be done by introducing a new         â”‚            
           â”‚ variable `green_duration` and updating the logic to increment it along with the count. 2. Guarantee the eventual transition from green to yellow when â”‚            
           â”‚ a pedestrian is present:  - In the existing logic for transitioning from green to yellow, ensure that the transition occurs when a pedestrian is      â”‚            
           â”‚ present, regardless of the duration in the green state. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional statements to prioritize the pedestrian     â”‚            
           â”‚ presence over the time criteria. 3. Explicitly consider the regular occurrence of the red state after each cycle of 60 seconds to address the         â”‚            
           â”‚ fairness specification:  - Introduce a new state or logic to handle the pending state after 60 seconds of being in the red state. This will ensure    â”‚            
           â”‚ that the traffic light system consistently cycles from red to green and back to red after completing each 60-second interval. By incorporating these  â”‚            
           â”‚ changes, the Python model will better align with the natural language description, enforce the required properties, and accurately simulate the       â”‚

           â”‚ when no pedestrian is present. This ensures consistency and adherence to the time-triggered behavior specified in the natural language description.   â”‚            
           â”‚ 2. Since the model does not include the "pending" state, consider updating the `state` Enum to include this additional state. This will align the     â”‚            
           â”‚ model with the original description and ensure all possible states are accounted for. 3. Modify the transition logic from `GREEN` to `YELLOW` to      â”‚            
           â”‚ check both the pedestrian presence and the duration of being in the `GREEN` state for at least 60 seconds before transitioning. This adjustment will  â”‚            
           â”‚ correct the safety specification issue identified in the grading feedback. 4. Ensure that the transitions between states are well-defined and         â”‚            
           â”‚ accurately reflect the behavior described in the natural language description. Pay close attention to timing constraints and input conditions for     â”‚            
           â”‚ transitions. 5. Consider adding comments within the code to clearly document the rationale behind specific design choices and transition conditions.  â”‚            
           â”‚ This will help in understanding the model and verifying its correctness against the original description and specifications. By implementing these    â”‚            
           â”‚ suggested changes, the model will be refined to better align with the requirements outlined in the natural language description, improving its        â”‚
