           â”‚ > Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the  â”‚            
           â”‚ traffic lights switch completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by            â”‚            
           â”‚ pedestrians who would like to cross the road. Model a parallel composition of two traffic lights. Model each traffic light  â”‚            
           â”‚ as a simple transition system with two states, one state modeling a red light, the other one modeling a green light.  In    â”‚            
           â”‚ principle, any form of interlocking of the "actions" of the two traffic lights is possible. For instance, in the initial    â”‚            
           â”‚ state where both traffic lights are red, there is a non-deterministic choice between which of the lights turns green. Note  â”‚            
           â”‚ that this nondeterminism is descriptive, and does not model a scheduling problem between the traffic lights (although it    â”‚

           â”‚ > To address the issues highlighted in the grading feedback, we need to make significant changes to the Python model. Here  â”‚            
           â”‚ are some actionable steps to improve the model and align it with the natural language description: 1. Introduce a state     â”‚            
           â”‚ variable to keep track of the current state of each traffic light (red or green). 2. Modify the initialization and next     â”‚            
           â”‚ functions to ensure that only one traffic light can be green at a time. 3. Include non-deterministic choices to model       â”‚            
           â”‚ transitions between red and green states when both traffic lights are initially red. 4. Add logic to guarantee that if both â”‚            
           â”‚ traffic lights are red, eventually one of them will turn green, and if both are green, at least one will turn red in the    â”‚            
           â”‚ next time step. Here's an improved version of the Python model: ```python class ParallelTrafficLights(Module):  state1 =    â”‚            
           â”‚ State()  state2 = State()  def init(self):   self.state1 = "red"   self.state2 = "red"  def next(self):   if (self.state1   â”‚            
           â”‚ == "red" and self.state2 == "red"):    choice = nondet()    if (choice == 1):     self.state1 = "green"    else:            â”‚            
           â”‚ self.state2 = "green"   else:    if (self.state1 == "green"):     self.state1 = "red"    if (self.state2 == "green"):       â”‚            
           â”‚ self.state2 = "red" ``` In this revised version: - The `state1` and `state2` variables represent the current state of each  â”‚            
           â”‚ traffic light. - The `init` function initializes both traffic lights to the red state. - The `next` function handles        â”‚            
           â”‚ transitions between red and green states, ensuring that only one traffic light can be green at a time. - Non-deterministic  â”‚            
           â”‚ choices are used to model transitions when both traffic lights are initially red. Implementing these changes should help    â”‚
