           â”‚ light model. The traffic lights can either be in a red or green state, henceforth denoted as `red1`, `green1` for the first traffic light, and        â”‚            
           â”‚ `red2`, `green2` for the second traffic light. 1. **Mutual Exclusivity of Light States per Traffic Light**:   - \( \text{Invariant 1: } \neg (red1    â”‚            
           â”‚ \land green1) \)  - \( \text{Invariant 2: } \neg (red2 \land green2) \) These invariants indicate that both traffic lights in their respective lanes  â”‚            
           â”‚ cannot be green and red at the same time. This ensures there is no state confusion or hazardous signal conflict for each traffic light. 2. **At Least â”‚            
           â”‚ One Light Is Always On**:  - \( \text{Invariant 3: } (red1 \lor green1) \)  - \( \text{Invariant 4: } (red2 \lor green2) \) Invariants 3 and 4        â”‚            
           â”‚ guarantee that each traffic light is always displaying either red or green, ensuring there is always a signal present. ### LTL Specifications for     â”‚            
           â”‚ Traffic Light System Next, we define LTL specifications, capturing temporal behaviors and constraints: 1. **Eventual Switching**: Each traffic light  â”‚            
           â”‚ must eventually switch between red and green states, reflecting normal operation.  - \( \text{LTL Spec 1: } G (red1 \rightarrow F green1) \)  - \(    â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{LTL Spec 2: } G (green1 \rightarrow F red1) \)  - \( \text{LTL Spec 3: } G (red2 \rightarrow F green2) \)  - \( \text{LTL Spec 4: } G (green2   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F red2) \) These LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) specifications state that globally, if a traffic light is red, it will eventually be green   â”‚            
           â”‚ and vice versa for each traffic light. This pattern should hold throughout the operation of the traffic lights. 2. **Independent Operations**: The    â”‚            
           â”‚ state change of one traffic light does not necessarily induce a state change in the other.  - \( \text{LTL Spec 5: } G (\neg (red1 \land F red2)) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ - \( \text{LTL Spec 6: } G (\neg (green1 \land F green2)) \) LTL Specs 5 and 6 express that the switching of one traffic light to red or green does   â”‚            
           â”‚ not force an immediate switching state in the other traffic light, permitting independent control as specified in the scenario. ### Explanation of    â”‚            
           â”‚ Relevance - The invariants ensure basic safety and operational clarity, such that no traffic light shows both signals at once and never shows no      â”‚            
           â”‚ signal. - The LTL specifications capture crucial operational characteristics such as independent operation of the lights and the assurance of normal  â”‚            
           â”‚ cycling between states, which are essential for functional traffic regulation. This formalization aids in verifying that the system adheres to safety â”‚            
           â”‚ norms and responds correctly under intended conditions, consistent with traffic control guidelines and independent operation requirements.            â”‚

           â”‚ light model. The traffic lights can either be in a red or green state, henceforth denoted as `red1`, `green1` for the first traffic light, and        â”‚            
           â”‚ `red2`, `green2` for the second traffic light. 1. **Mutual Exclusivity of Light States per Traffic Light**:   - \( \text{Invariant 1: } \neg (red1    â”‚            
           â”‚ \land green1) \)  - \( \text{Invariant 2: } \neg (red2 \land green2) \) These invariants indicate that both traffic lights in their respective lanes  â”‚            
           â”‚ cannot be green and red at the same time. This ensures there is no state confusion or hazardous signal conflict for each traffic light. 2. **At Least â”‚            
           â”‚ One Light Is Always On**:  - \( \text{Invariant 3: } (red1 \lor green1) \)  - \( \text{Invariant 4: } (red2 \lor green2) \) Invariants 3 and 4        â”‚            
           â”‚ guarantee that each traffic light is always displaying either red or green, ensuring there is always a signal present. ### LTL Specifications for     â”‚            
           â”‚ Traffic Light System Next, we define LTL specifications, capturing temporal behaviors and constraints: 1. **Eventual Switching**: Each traffic light  â”‚            
           â”‚ must eventually switch between red and green states, reflecting normal operation.  - \( \text{LTL Spec 1: } G (red1 \rightarrow F green1) \)  - \(    â”‚            
           â”‚ \text{LTL Spec 2: } G (green1 \rightarrow F red1) \)  - \( \text{LTL Spec 3: } G (red2 \rightarrow F green2) \)  - \( \text{LTL Spec 4: } G (green2   â”‚            
           â”‚ \rightarrow F red2) \) These LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) specifications state that globally, if a traffic light is red, it will eventually be green   â”‚            
           â”‚ and vice versa for each traffic light. This pattern should hold throughout the operation of the traffic lights. 2. **Independent Operations**: The    â”‚            
           â”‚ state change of one traffic light does not necessarily induce a state change in the other.  - \( \text{LTL Spec 5: } G (\neg (red1 \land F red2)) \)  â”‚            
           â”‚ - \( \text{LTL Spec 6: } G (\neg (green1 \land F green2)) \) LTL Specs 5 and 6 express that the switching of one traffic light to red or green does   â”‚            
           â”‚ not force an immediate switching state in the other traffic light, permitting independent control as specified in the scenario. ### Explanation of    â”‚            
           â”‚ Relevance - The invariants ensure basic safety and operational clarity, such that no traffic light shows both signals at once and never shows no      â”‚            
           â”‚ signal. - The LTL specifications capture crucial operational characteristics such as independent operation of the lights and the assurance of normal  â”‚            
           â”‚ cycling between states, which are essential for functional traffic regulation. This formalization aids in verifying that the system adheres to safety â”‚            
           â”‚ norms and responds correctly under intended conditions, consistent with traffic control guidelines and independent operation requirements.            â”‚
