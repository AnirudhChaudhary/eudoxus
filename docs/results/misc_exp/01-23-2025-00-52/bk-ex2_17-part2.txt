You are a critic. In the following example, I will give you a natural language description of a system that I want to model followed by my current model of the system. 

System Description: Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the traffic lights switch completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by pedestrians who would like to cross the road.

Model a parallel composition of two traffic lights. Model each traffic light as a simple transition system with two states, one state modeling a red light, the other one modeling a green light.


In principle, any form of interlocking of the "actions" of the two traffic lights is possible. For instance, in the initial state where both traffic lights are red, there is a non-deterministic choice between which of the lights turns green. Note that this nondeterminism is descriptive, and does not model a scheduling problem between the traffic lights (although it may seem so).

Use the variable names red1, green1, red2 and green 2.

Model: module TrafficLights {
  type state = boolean;

  var red1: state;
  var green1: state;
  var red2: state;
  var green2: state;

  init {
    red1 = true;
    green1 = false;
    red2 = true;
    green2 = false;

  }
  next {
    if (red1 && red2) {
      green1' = true;
      red2' = false;
    } else {
      green2' = true;
      red1' = false;
    }

  }
}

Please go through and critique whether or not the current provided model is semantically the same as the system description. First answer yes or no and then give your explanation, being very thorough with your explanation.

GPT Response: 
No, the current provided model is not semantically the same as the system description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Lack of Individual Independence:** The model's logic in the `next` block does not respect the assumed independence of the two traffic lights. According to the description, the transition systems for both traffic lights should operate completely independently of each other. However, the current model imposes a direct interaction between the states of the two lights. For instance, if both lights are red (`red1 && red2`), the model dictates that `green1` should turn true and `red2` should turn false, thus forcing one light to turn green and the other to turn red without any randomness or independence in selection.

2. **Nondeterminism Not Modeled Correctly:** The system description implies that there should be nondeterminism in choosing which light turns green when both are red. This nondeterminism is not correctly implemented in the model. The `next` block forces a particular sequence (green1 true, red1 false) without allowing for the independent or nondeterministic choice between `green1` and `green2`.

3. **Incorrect Transition Logic:** The `next` state logic only includes transitions when both lights are red. It does not define transitions for other possible states, such as when one light is green and the other is red, or if both are green (which shouldn't logically happen but is not restricted by the model). There should be transitions defined for toggling each light from green to red and vice versa independently.

4. **State Redundancy and Lack of Mutual Exclusivity:** The model uses four boolean variables to represent the states of two lights. This approach introduces potential state redundancy since each light's state can be represented with just one boolean (true for green, false for red). Furthermore, by using two variables per light, mutual exclusivity between the `red` and `green` states of a single light is not inherently enforced in the model (both can be true or both false).

5. **Initialization and Transition Clarity:** While the `init` block correctly sets the initial conditions with both traffic lights at red, the `next` block potentially (as per current model logic flaws) makes a single change and does not account for subsequent transitions after the initial change. The model must explicitly handle the ongoing operations of each light cycle.

To address these issues, one needs to revise the model ensuring that each light operates independently and can transition from green to red and vice versa autonomically. This would involve simplifying the state representation (possible use of a single state variable with associated values such as "green" or "red"), ensuring transitions account for all possible states, and encapsulating transitions for each light separately while adhering to nondeterminism principles specified.
