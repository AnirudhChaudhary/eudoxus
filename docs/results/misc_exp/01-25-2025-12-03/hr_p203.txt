           â”‚ > The alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a protocol for transmitting messages along a 'lossy line,' i.e., a line which may lose or duplicate messages. â”‚            
           â”‚ The protocol guarantees that, providing the line doesn't lose infinitely many messages, communication between the sender and the receiver will be     â”‚            
           â”‚ successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt messages; however, there is no way of guaranteeing successful    â”‚            
           â”‚ transmission along a line which can corrupt.) The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the receiver, the message     â”‚            
           â”‚ channel and the acknowledgement channel. The sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the      â”‚            
           â”‚ receiver receives a message with the control bit 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it   â”‚            
           â”‚ sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If and when the receiver receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel.  â”‚            
           â”‚ By alternating the control bit, both receiver and sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages (i.e., they ignore messages that  â”‚            
           â”‚ have the unexpected control bit). If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the              â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgement arrives. If the receiver doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement.    â”‚

           â”‚ You are a grader. In the following example, I will give you a natural language description of a system that I want to model followed by my current    â”‚            
           â”‚ model of the system.                                                                                                                                  â”‚            
           â”‚ System Description: The alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a protocol for transmitting messages along a 'lossy line,' i.e., a line which may lose or   â”‚            
           â”‚ duplicate messages. The protocol guarantees that, providing the line doesn't lose infinitely many messages, communication between the sender and the  â”‚            
           â”‚ receiver will be successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt messages; however, there is no way of           â”‚            
           â”‚ guaranteeing successful transmission along a line which can corrupt.)                                                                                 â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚            
           â”‚ The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the receiver, the message channel and the acknowledgement channel. The      â”‚            
           â”‚ sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the receiver receives a message with the control bit  â”‚            
           â”‚ 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If   â”‚            
           â”‚ and when the receiver receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel. By alternating the control bit, both receiver and â”‚            
           â”‚ sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages (i.e., they ignore messages that have the unexpected control bit).                  â”‚            
           â”‚ If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the acknowledgement arrives. If the receiver       â”‚            
           â”‚ doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement.                                             â”‚            
           â”‚                                                                                                                                                       â”‚

           â”‚ 1. **Class Definition and Variables**:                                                                                                                â”‚            
           â”‚    - The `AlternatingBitProtocol` class correctly inherits from what appears to be a super class `Module` (assumed here though not discussed in the   â”‚            
           â”‚ description). The use of boolean variables `self.st`, `self.sender_control`, and `self.receiver_control` is somewhat aligned with the notion of       â”‚            
           â”‚ control bits.                                                                                                                                         â”‚            
           â”‚    - However, it's not entirely clear what `self.st` (possibly "state") represents in the context of the protocol. The control bits should be         â”‚            
           â”‚ sufficient to manage the state transitions between the sender and receiver.                                                                           â”‚

           â”‚ 2. **Inputs and Initialization**:                                                                                                                     â”‚            
           â”‚    - The model defines two inputs: `self.sender_message` and `self.receiver_message`. It is unclear why these are booleans since messages generally   â”‚            
           â”‚ involve data transfer (this could represent merely the reception state).                                                                              â”‚            
           â”‚    - Initialization sets `self.st = True`, `self.sender_control = False`, and `self.receiver_control = False`, setting an initial state. But in ABP,  â”‚            
           â”‚ distinguishing between sender and receiver control states at initialization does not necessarily reflect protocol execution directly tied with the    â”‚            
           â”‚ bit alternating logic.                                                                                                                                â”‚

           â”‚ 3. **Transition Logic (`next` method)**:                                                                                                              â”‚            
           â”‚    - The use of `self.st` confuses the protocol logic. Typical ABP logic would not use an additional overarching boolean but would rely on            â”‚            
           â”‚ controlling bits' state.                                                                                                                              â”‚            
           â”‚    - The transitions try to switch controls based on comparison of `self.sender_message` and `self.receiver_message`. This, however, misses the       â”‚            
           â”‚ essential repeated sending when acknowledgements or messages are not received due to line faults.                                                     â”‚            
           â”‚    - The logic does not embody the continual re-sending (both the message by the sender and the acknowledgment by the receiver) until the correct     â”‚            
           â”‚ acknowledgment or message is received.                                                                                                                â”‚

           â”‚    - The specification simply returns a boolean expression connecting the states of control bits with the state `self.st`. This does not correspond   â”‚

           â”‚    - The lack of robust conditions or checks for verification against the correct sequence of sending and receiving using alternating bits is a       â”‚            
           â”‚ significant omission.                                                                                                                                 â”‚
