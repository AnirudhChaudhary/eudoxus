           â”‚ > Consider a (strongly simplified) booking system at a cashier of a supermarket. The system consists of three processes: the bar code reader BCR, the â”‚            
           â”‚ actual booking program BP, and the printer Printer. The bar code reader reads a bar code and communicates the data of the just scanned product to the â”‚            
           â”‚ booking program. On receiving such data, the booking program transmits the price of the article to the printer that prints the article Id together    â”‚            
           â”‚ with the price on the receipt. The interactions between the bar code reader and the booking program, and between the booking program and the printer  â”‚            
           â”‚ is performed by handshaking. Each process consist of just two states, named 0 and 1. BCR transitions from state 0 to state 1 when a bar code is       â”‚            
           â”‚ scanned, and from state 1 to state 0 when the data is sent to BP. BP transitions from state 0 to state 1 when it receives data from BCR, and from     â”‚            
           â”‚ state 1 to state 0 when it sends the print command to the printer Printer transitions from state 0 to state 1 when the print code is sent by BP, and  â”‚            
           â”‚ from state 1 to state 0 when the article is printed.  The complete system is given by: BCR || BP || Printer. Model this system. Use the variable      â”‚
