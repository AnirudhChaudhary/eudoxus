           │ > Model a design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda. It counts the number of soda and beer bottles and        │            
           │ returns inserted coins if the vending machine is empty. The vending machine is represented by the two locations start and select, and has variables   │            
           │ that store the number of soda bottles (nsoda), and the number of beer bottles (nbeer). The following conditional transitions model the insertion of a │            
           │ coin and refilling the vending machine: start --(true:coin)-> select start --(true:refill)-> start  Labels of conditional transitions are of the form │            
           │ (g : a ) where g is a Boolean condition (called guard), and a is an action that is possible once g holds. As the condition for both conditional       │            
           │ transitions above always holds, the action coin is always enabled in the starting location. To keep things simple, we assume that by refill both      │            
           │ storages are entirely refilled. The following transitions model that soda (or beer) can be obtained if there is some soda (or beer) left in the       │            
           │ vending machine: select --(nsoda > 0:sget)-> start select --(nbeer > 0:bget)-> start Finally, the vending machine automatically switches to the       │            
           │ initial start location while returning the inserted coin once there are no bottles left: select --(nsoda=0 & nbeer=0: ret_coin) -> start Let the      │            
           │ maximum capacity of both bottle repositories be max. The insertion of a coin (by action coin) leaves the number of bottles unchanged. The same        │            
           │ applies when a coin is returned (by action ret coin). The effect of the other actions is as follows: refill : nsoda:=max & nbeer:=max sget:           │            
           │ nsoda:=nsoda-1 bget: nbeer:=nbeer-1 You may use boolean variables to indicate when an action is enabled. Use the variable names nsoda, nbeer, sget,   │            
           │ bget, refill, coin.                                                                                                                                   │

           │ > Model a design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda. It counts the number of soda and beer bottles and        │            
           │ returns inserted coins if the vending machine is empty. The vending machine is represented by the two locations start and select, and has variables   │            
           │ that store the number of soda bottles (nsoda), and the number of beer bottles (nbeer). The following conditional transitions model the insertion of a │            
           │ coin and refilling the vending machine: start --(true:coin)-> select start --(true:refill)-> start  Labels of conditional transitions are of the form │            
           │ (g : a ) where g is a Boolean condition (called guard), and a is an action that is possible once g holds. As the condition for both conditional       │            
           │ transitions above always holds, the action coin is always enabled in the starting location. To keep things simple, we assume that by refill both      │            
           │ storages are entirely refilled. The following transitions model that soda (or beer) can be obtained if there is some soda (or beer) left in the       │            
           │ vending machine: select --(nsoda > 0:sget)-> start select --(nbeer > 0:bget)-> start Finally, the vending machine automatically switches to the       │            
           │ initial start location while returning the inserted coin once there are no bottles left: select --(nsoda=0 & nbeer=0: ret_coin) -> start Let the      │            
           │ maximum capacity of both bottle repositories be max. The insertion of a coin (by action coin) leaves the number of bottles unchanged. The same        │            
           │ applies when a coin is returned (by action ret coin). The effect of the other actions is as follows: refill : nsoda:=max & nbeer:=max sget:           │            
           │ nsoda:=nsoda-1 bget: nbeer:=nbeer-1 You may use boolean variables to indicate when an action is enabled. Use the variable names nsoda, nbeer, sget,   │

           │ > Model a design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda. It counts the number of soda and beer bottles and        │            
           │ returns inserted coins if the vending machine is empty. The vending machine is represented by the two locations start and select, and has variables   │            
           │ that store the number of soda bottles (nsoda), and the number of beer bottles (nbeer). The following conditional transitions model the insertion of a │            
           │ coin and refilling the vending machine: start --(true:coin)-> select start --(true:refill)-> start  Labels of conditional transitions are of the form │            
           │ (g : a ) where g is a Boolean condition (called guard), and a is an action that is possible once g holds. As the condition for both conditional       │            
           │ transitions above always holds, the action coin is always enabled in the starting location. To keep things simple, we assume that by refill both      │            
           │ storages are entirely refilled. The following transitions model that soda (or beer) can be obtained if there is some soda (or beer) left in the       │            
           │ vending machine: select --(nsoda > 0:sget)-> start select --(nbeer > 0:bget)-> start Finally, the vending machine automatically switches to the       │            
           │ initial start location while returning the inserted coin once there are no bottles left: select --(nsoda=0 & nbeer=0: ret_coin) -> start Let the      │            
           │ maximum capacity of both bottle repositories be max. The insertion of a coin (by action coin) leaves the number of bottles unchanged. The same        │            
           │ applies when a coin is returned (by action ret coin). The effect of the other actions is as follows: refill : nsoda:=max & nbeer:=max sget:           │            
           │ nsoda:=nsoda-1 bget: nbeer:=nbeer-1 You may use boolean variables to indicate when an action is enabled. Use the variable names nsoda, nbeer, sget,   │

           │ > Model a design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda. It counts the number of soda and beer bottles and        │            
           │ returns inserted coins if the vending machine is empty. The vending machine is represented by the two locations start and select, and has variables   │            
           │ that store the number of soda bottles (nsoda), and the number of beer bottles (nbeer). The following conditional transitions model the insertion of a │            
           │ coin and refilling the vending machine: start --(true:coin)-> select start --(true:refill)-> start  Labels of conditional transitions are of the form │            
           │ (g : a ) where g is a Boolean condition (called guard), and a is an action that is possible once g holds. As the condition for both conditional       │            
           │ transitions above always holds, the action coin is always enabled in the starting location. To keep things simple, we assume that by refill both      │            
           │ storages are entirely refilled. The following transitions model that soda (or beer) can be obtained if there is some soda (or beer) left in the       │            
           │ vending machine: select --(nsoda > 0:sget)-> start select --(nbeer > 0:bget)-> start Finally, the vending machine automatically switches to the       │            
           │ initial start location while returning the inserted coin once there are no bottles left: select --(nsoda=0 & nbeer=0: ret_coin) -> start Let the      │            
           │ maximum capacity of both bottle repositories be max. The insertion of a coin (by action coin) leaves the number of bottles unchanged. The same        │            
           │ applies when a coin is returned (by action ret coin). The effect of the other actions is as follows: refill : nsoda:=max & nbeer:=max sget:           │            
           │ nsoda:=nsoda-1 bget: nbeer:=nbeer-1 You may use boolean variables to indicate when an action is enabled. Use the variable names nsoda, nbeer, sget,   │

           │ > Model a design of a beverage vending machine. The machine can either deliver beer or soda. It counts the number of soda and beer bottles and        │            
           │ returns inserted coins if the vending machine is empty. The vending machine is represented by the two locations start and select, and has variables   │            
           │ that store the number of soda bottles (nsoda), and the number of beer bottles (nbeer). The following conditional transitions model the insertion of a │            
           │ coin and refilling the vending machine: start --(true:coin)-> select start --(true:refill)-> start  Labels of conditional transitions are of the form │            
           │ (g : a ) where g is a Boolean condition (called guard), and a is an action that is possible once g holds. As the condition for both conditional       │            
           │ transitions above always holds, the action coin is always enabled in the starting location. To keep things simple, we assume that by refill both      │            
           │ storages are entirely refilled. The following transitions model that soda (or beer) can be obtained if there is some soda (or beer) left in the       │            
           │ vending machine: select --(nsoda > 0:sget)-> start select --(nbeer > 0:bget)-> start Finally, the vending machine automatically switches to the       │            
           │ initial start location while returning the inserted coin once there are no bottles left: select --(nsoda=0 & nbeer=0: ret_coin) -> start Let the      │            
           │ maximum capacity of both bottle repositories be max. The insertion of a coin (by action coin) leaves the number of bottles unchanged. The same        │            
           │ applies when a coin is returned (by action ret coin). The effect of the other actions is as follows: refill : nsoda:=max & nbeer:=max sget:           │            
           │ nsoda:=nsoda-1 bget: nbeer:=nbeer-1 You may use boolean variables to indicate when an action is enabled. Use the variable names nsoda, nbeer, sget,   │
