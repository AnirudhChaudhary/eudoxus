           â”‚    - The system description    â”‚            
           â”‚ specifies that the heater      â”‚            
           â”‚ should turn on if the          â”‚            
           â”‚ temperature is "less than or   â”‚            
           â”‚ equal to 20 degrees Celsius".  â”‚            
           â”‚ But in the model, the heater   â”‚            
           â”‚ can turn off or on at wrong    â”‚            
           â”‚ points:                        â”‚            
           â”‚      - If the temperature is   â”‚            
           â”‚ greater than 20 degrees and    â”‚            
           â”‚ `time` is at least 120         â”‚

           â”‚ turn off (`self.heatOff =      â”‚

           â”‚ condition, if the temperature  â”‚            
           â”‚ drops to 20 degrees or less    â”‚            
           â”‚ again and the time since being â”‚

           â”‚ `self.heatOn` remains True,    â”‚            
           â”‚ which violates the initial     â”‚            
           â”‚ specification that the heater  â”‚            
           â”‚ should be off for at least 2   â”‚            
           â”‚ minutes.                       â”‚            
           â”‚    - The simultaneous usage    â”‚            
           â”‚ and updating of `heatOn` and   â”‚            
           â”‚ `heatOff` create confusion,    â”‚            
           â”‚ leading to potential           â”‚            
           â”‚ situations where both could    â”‚
