           â”‚ 1. **Variable Initialization   â”‚

           â”‚ represent that no coins have   â”‚

           â”‚    - The `coin` variable seems â”‚            
           â”‚ to be intended to capture the  â”‚            
           â”‚ number of coins inserted at    â”‚

           â”‚ initialization and exact       â”‚

           â”‚ inserted at each step), but    â”‚            
           â”‚ there's no explicit handling   â”‚            
           â”‚ in `init()` or clarity on its  â”‚            
           â”‚ per-step updating scheme,      â”‚            
           â”‚ which could be a dynamic input â”‚            
           â”‚ that should be modeled more    â”‚            
           â”‚ explicitly.                    â”‚

           â”‚ Dispensing Drinks**:           â”‚            
           â”‚    - The model adds coins to   â”‚            
           â”‚ `total_coins` whenever `coin > â”‚            
           â”‚ 0`. This is reasonable,        â”‚            
           â”‚ implying that coins are        â”‚

           â”‚    - The condition `if         â”‚            
           â”‚ (self.dispensed_drinks > 0)`   â”‚            
           â”‚ checks if any drinks have been â”‚            
           â”‚ dispensed. If yes, it asserts  â”‚            
           â”‚ that `total_coins` is at least â”‚            
           â”‚ the number of                  â”‚            
           â”‚ `dispensed_drinks`. This looks â”‚            
           â”‚ like a safety checking         â”‚

           â”‚ of reducing the `total_coins`  â”‚            
           â”‚ when drinks are dispensed. An  â”‚            
           â”‚ actual drink dispensing should â”‚            
           â”‚ decrement `total_coins` based  â”‚            
           â”‚ on the cost of dispensed       â”‚            
           â”‚ drinks, rather than just       â”‚

           â”‚ 3. **Safety Property**:        â”‚            
           â”‚    - You asked that it checks  â”‚            
           â”‚ whether the number of inserted â”‚            
           â”‚ coins is always at least the   â”‚            
           â”‚ number of dispensed drinks.    â”‚            
           â”‚ The provided model checks this â”‚            
           â”‚ but only when a drink is       â”‚

           â”‚ implementation because it      â”‚            
           â”‚ leaves out the specification   â”‚            
           â”‚ for scenarios where no drink   â”‚            
           â”‚ is dispensed even though coins â”‚            
           â”‚ might have been inserted.      â”‚            
           â”‚    - Given that                â”‚

           â”‚ as a form of input or tracked  â”‚            
           â”‚ state change, its              â”‚            
           â”‚ initialization and             â”‚            
           â”‚ step-by-step updating are also â”‚            
           â”‚ unclear. This can lead to      â”‚            
           â”‚ uncertainty about the exact    â”‚
