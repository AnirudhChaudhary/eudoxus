           â”‚ initializes `x` to 0. Though   â”‚

           â”‚ statement) for the values of x â”‚            
           â”‚ to determine its next state,   â”‚            
           â”‚ such as incrementing if x <    â”‚            
           â”‚ 200, decrementing if x > 0,    â”‚

           â”‚ the requirement to ensure x is â”‚            
           â”‚ always between 0 and 200.      â”‚            
           â”‚ However, the invariant alone   â”‚

           â”‚    - Invariant enforcement     â”‚            
           â”‚ should also be part of the     â”‚            
           â”‚ `next` method to guarantee     â”‚            
           â”‚ these conditions as x is       â”‚

           â”‚    - The description suggests  â”‚            
           â”‚ a concurrent program, but      â”‚            
           â”‚ there's no explicit handling   â”‚            
           â”‚ or modeling of concurrency in  â”‚

           â”‚    - Proper handling might     â”‚
