           â”‚ Write Python code that extends â”‚            
           â”‚ the `Module` class below to    â”‚            
           â”‚ complete the following task.   â”‚

           â”‚ > Consider the intersection of â”‚            
           â”‚ two one-way streets, called    â”‚            
           â”‚ Main and Secondary. A light on â”‚            
           â”‚ each street controls its       â”‚            
           â”‚ traffic. Each light goes       â”‚            
           â”‚ through a cycle consisting of  â”‚            
           â”‚ a red (R), green (G), and      â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow (Y) phases. It is a     â”‚            
           â”‚ safety requirement that when   â”‚            
           â”‚ one light is in its green or   â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow phase, the other is in  â”‚            
           â”‚ its red phase. The yellow      â”‚            
           â”‚ phase is always 5 seconds      â”‚            
           â”‚ long. The traffic lights       â”‚            
           â”‚ operate as follows. A sensor   â”‚            
           â”‚ in the secondary road detects  â”‚            
           â”‚ a vehicle. While no vehicle is â”‚            
           â”‚ detected, there is a 4         â”‚            
           â”‚ minute-long cycle with the     â”‚            
           â”‚ main light having 3 minutes of â”‚            
           â”‚ green, 5 seconds of yellow,    â”‚            
           â”‚ and 55 seconds of red. The     â”‚            
           â”‚ secondary light is red for 3   â”‚            
           â”‚ minutes and 5 seconds (while   â”‚            
           â”‚ the main light is green and    â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow), green for 50 seconds, â”‚            
           â”‚ then yellow for 5 seconds. If  â”‚            
           â”‚ a vehicle is detected on the   â”‚            
           â”‚ secondary road, the traffic    â”‚            
           â”‚ light quickly gives a right of â”‚            
           â”‚ way to the secondary road.     â”‚            
           â”‚ When this happens, the main    â”‚            
           â”‚ light aborts its green phase   â”‚            
           â”‚ and immediately switches to    â”‚            
           â”‚ its 5 second yellow phase. If  â”‚            
           â”‚ the vehicle is detected while  â”‚            
           â”‚ the main light is yellow or    â”‚            
           â”‚ red, the system continues as   â”‚            
           â”‚ if there were no vehicle.      â”‚            
           â”‚ Model a system that controls   â”‚            
           â”‚ the lights. Let this system    â”‚            
           â”‚ have six pure outputs, one for â”‚

           â”‚ red, respectively, and sG, sY, â”‚

           â”‚ secondary light being green,   â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow, or red, respectively.  â”‚

           â”‚ the timer resets every 720     â”‚            
           â”‚ ticks and appears to manage    â”‚            
           â”‚ cycles differently, causing    â”‚
