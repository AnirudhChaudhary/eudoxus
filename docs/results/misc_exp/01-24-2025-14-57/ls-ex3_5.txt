           â”‚ 1. **State Management**: The   â”‚            
           â”‚ original system description    â”‚            
           â”‚ stipulates that the device     â”‚            
           â”‚ should manage two states:      â”‚            
           â”‚ heating and cooling (which     â”‚            
           â”‚ indirectly implies that there  â”‚            
           â”‚ needs to be a way to store     â”‚

           â”‚ `Thermostat` class does not    â”‚            
           â”‚ effectively differentiate      â”‚            
           â”‚ between the heating and        â”‚            
           â”‚ cooling states. The provided   â”‚            
           â”‚ model apparently mismanages    â”‚            
           â”‚ the states of heating, and the â”‚            
           â”‚ concept of cooling is not      â”‚            
           â”‚ defined at all.                â”‚

           â”‚ 2. **Output Logic for `heatOn` â”‚            
           â”‚ and `heatOff`**:               â”‚            
           â”‚    - In your model, `heatOn`   â”‚            
           â”‚ is assigned `True` only when   â”‚            
           â”‚ `temp` is equal to or falls    â”‚            
           â”‚ below 18.0 degrees.            â”‚            
           â”‚ Conversely, `heatOn` is set to â”‚            
           â”‚ `False` (i.e., heating is      â”‚            
           â”‚ turned off) when `temp`        â”‚            
           â”‚ reaches or exceeds 22.0        â”‚            
           â”‚ degrees. However, your model   â”‚            
           â”‚ essentially uses a             â”‚            
           â”‚ reassignment (`self.heatOn =   â”‚            
           â”‚ self.heatOn`) that does not    â”‚            
           â”‚ alter the state based on       â”‚            
           â”‚ current conditions when the    â”‚            
           â”‚ temperature is between 18.0    â”‚            
           â”‚ degrees and 22.0 degrees. This â”‚            
           â”‚ could lead to errant behaviors â”‚            
           â”‚ or state retention which       â”‚            
           â”‚ doesnâ€™t align with hysteresis  â”‚            
           â”‚ principles properly.           â”‚            
           â”‚    - Moreover, `heatOff` is    â”‚            
           â”‚ always the logical negation of â”‚            
           â”‚ `heatOn`, thereby making it    â”‚            
           â”‚ redundant or potentially       â”‚            
           â”‚ misleading. It also            â”‚            
           â”‚ contradicts the requirement in â”‚            
           â”‚ the problem statement that     â”‚            
           â”‚ outputs should indicate when   â”‚

           â”‚ heater status (turning it on   â”‚            
           â”‚ or off). Always providing a    â”‚            
           â”‚ `heatOff` state directly       â”‚            
           â”‚ opposing `heatOn` could cause  â”‚            
           â”‚ misinterpretations or          â”‚            
           â”‚ erroneous outputs where no     â”‚
