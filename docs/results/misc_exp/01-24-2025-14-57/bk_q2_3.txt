           â”‚ No, the current provided model â”‚            
           â”‚ is not semantically the same   â”‚            
           â”‚ as the system description.     â”‚            
           â”‚                                â”‚            
           â”‚ Explanation:                   â”‚            
           â”‚                                â”‚            
           â”‚ 1. **Type Definition Error**:  â”‚            
           â”‚    - The model defines         â”‚            
           â”‚ `self.Var` as an enum          â”‚            
           â”‚ containing only the states     â”‚            
           â”‚ "amber," "green," and "red."   â”‚            
           â”‚ However, according to the      â”‚            
           â”‚ system description, the        â”‚            
           â”‚ traffic light states should    â”‚            
           â”‚ include "yellow" as well. This â”‚            
           â”‚ is a significant omission as   â”‚            
           â”‚ "yellow" typically follows     â”‚            
           â”‚ "green" before turning to      â”‚            
           â”‚ "red," differing from "amber." â”‚            
           â”‚ The model either needs to add  â”‚            
           â”‚ "yellow" or clarify if "amber" â”‚            
           â”‚ was a mistyping of "yellow."   â”‚            
           â”‚                                â”‚            
           â”‚ 2. **State Transition Error**: â”‚            
           â”‚    - The description suggests  â”‚            
           â”‚ that there should be four      â”‚            
           â”‚ distinct states (green,        â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow, red, amber) in a       â”‚            
           â”‚ specific order. However, the   â”‚            
           â”‚ model only uses three of these â”‚            
           â”‚ states ("amber," "green,"      â”‚            
           â”‚ "red") and doesn't             â”‚            
           â”‚ specifically implement         â”‚            
           â”‚ transitions through all        â”‚            
           â”‚ required states in the correct â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence.                      â”‚            
           â”‚                                â”‚            
           â”‚ 3. **Transition Logic Error**: â”‚            
           â”‚    - According to the model,   â”‚            
           â”‚ when `L1` and `L3` transition  â”‚            
           â”‚ from "green" to "amber" and    â”‚            
           â”‚ then to "red," `L2` is         â”‚            
           â”‚ immediately set to "green."    â”‚            
           â”‚ There is no account of a       â”‚            
           â”‚ yellow state between "green"   â”‚            
           â”‚ and "red" transitions for any  â”‚            
           â”‚ of the lights, nor an          â”‚            
           â”‚ intermediate "amber" or        â”‚            
           â”‚ "yellow" state for `L2` before â”‚            
           â”‚ it turns "green." This means   â”‚            
           â”‚ there is likely missing logic  â”‚            
           â”‚ for appropriately spacing      â”‚            
           â”‚ these transitions to prevent   â”‚            
           â”‚ collisions at the junction.    â”‚            
           â”‚    - Similarly, after `L2`     â”‚            
           â”‚ turns from "green" to "red,"   â”‚            
           â”‚ `L4` is directly set to        â”‚            
           â”‚ "green." The transitions are   â”‚            
           â”‚ abrupt and do not follow a     â”‚            
           â”‚ real-world traffic light       â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence where there would     â”‚            
           â”‚ typically be buffer states     â”‚            
           â”‚ (like "yellow").               â”‚            
           â”‚                                â”‚            
           â”‚ 4. **Missing Conditionals for  â”‚            
           â”‚ Other States**:                â”‚            
           â”‚    - The model only accounts   â”‚            
           â”‚ for transitions from the       â”‚            
           â”‚ green, amber, and to red       â”‚            
           â”‚ state. If a traffic light is   â”‚            
           â”‚ initially at "red," the        â”‚            
           â”‚ conditions do not describe how â”‚            
           â”‚ it should transition back to   â”‚            
           â”‚ "green," except where          â”‚            
           â”‚ specifically programmed in     â”‚            
           â”‚ sequence for `L1, L3, L2, L4.` â”‚            
           â”‚ What happens if the system is  â”‚            
           â”‚ reset or started in            â”‚            
           â”‚ mid-sequence is not addressed, â”‚            
           â”‚ resulting in logical           â”‚            
           â”‚ inconsistencies or undefined   â”‚

           â”‚ Given these discrepancies, the â”‚            
           â”‚ model fails to implement the   â”‚
