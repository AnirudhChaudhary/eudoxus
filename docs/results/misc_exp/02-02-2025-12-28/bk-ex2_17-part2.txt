           │ > Consider the transition systems of two traffic lights for nonintersecting (i.e., parallel) roads. It is assumed that the traffic lights switch      │            
           │ completely independent of each other. For example, the traffic lights may be controlled by pedestrians who would like to cross the road. Model a      │            
           │ parallel composition of two traffic lights. Model each traffic light as a simple transition system with two states, one state modeling a red light,   │            
           │ the other one modeling a green light.  In principle, any form of interlocking of the "actions" of the two traffic lights is possible. For instance,   │            
           │ in the initial state where both traffic lights are red, there is a non-deterministic choice between which of the lights turns green. Note that this   │
