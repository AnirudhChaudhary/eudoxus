It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "module process1\n{\n  type pc_t = enum { A };\n\n  var pc : pc_t;\n  input s : boolean; // secret input\n  input x : boolean; // public input\n  output z: boolean; // public output\n\n  init {\n    pc = A;\n    z = false;\n  }\n\n  next {\n    z' = !x;\n  }\n\n}\n\nmodule process2\n{\n  type pc_t = enum { B, C };\n\n  var pc : pc_t;\n  input s : boolean; // secret input\n  input x : boolean; // public input\n  output z: boolean; // public output\n\n  procedure next_state()\n    modifies z;\n    modifies pc;\n  {\n    case\n      (pc == B) && s && !x : { pc = C; z = true; }\n      (pc == C) && s && !x : { pc = B; z = false; }\n    esac\n  }\n\n  init {\n    pc = B;\n    z = false;\n  }\n\n  next {\n    call next_state();\n  }\n}\n\n\nmodule main\n{\n  type t1pc_t = process1.pc_t;\n  type t2pc_t = process2.pc_t;\n\n  var x1,x2 : boolean;\n  var s1,s2 : boolean;\n  var z1,z2 : boolean;\n\n/*\n  instance p11 : process1(z: (z1), s : (s1), x : (x1));\n  instance p12 : process1(z: (z2), s : (s2), x : (x2));\n*/\n\n/* \n*/\n  instance p21 : process2(z: (z1), s : (s1), x : (x1));\n  instance p22 : process2(z: (z2), s : (s2), x : (x2));\n\n  init {\n    havoc x1; havoc x2; \n    havoc s1; havoc s2; \n    assume(x1 == x2);\n  }\n\n  next {\n    havoc x1; havoc x2; \n    havoc s1; havoc s2; \n    assume(x1' == x2');\n    // next(p11); next(p12);\n    next(p21); next(p22);\n  }\n\n  invariant same_output_z : (z1 == z2);\n\n\n  control {\n    // *** BASIC ASSERTIONS/INVARIANT\n/*\n*/\n    v = unroll(5);\n    check;\n    print_results;\n    //v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p11.pc,p12.pc);\n    v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p21.pc,p22.pc);\n\n/*\n    // *** INDUCTION\n    v = induction(1); \n    check;\n    print_results;\n    v.print_cex(x1,x2,s1,s2,z1,z2,p11.pc,p12.pc);\n*/\n  }\n}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a uclid5 model for the following description: \nFor a railroad crossing a control system needs to be developed that on receipt of a signal indicating that a train is approaching closes the gates, and only opens these gates after the train has sent a signal indicating that it crossed the road.

The states \"up\" and \"down\" of the Gate have the obvious interpretation. The controller has 4 states 0, 1, 2 and 3.
