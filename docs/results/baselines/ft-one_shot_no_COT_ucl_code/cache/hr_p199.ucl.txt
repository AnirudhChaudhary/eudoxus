system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:

This UCLID5 model, inspired by Lee & Seshia's "Introduction to Embedded Systems," simulates interactions between processes to evaluate confidentiality through non-interference simulations. It features two modules, `process1` and `process2`, each handling inputs and outputs differently based on internal states and external inputs. `process1` uses a simple state and toggles its output based on the negation of a public input, while `process2` incorporates a more complex state transition system that toggles outputs based on both secret and public inputs. The main module orchestrates interactions between instances of these processes under controlled conditions, ensuring that the output remains consistent across different runs despite variations in secret inputs. This setup is used for bounded model checking to analyze potential security vulnerabilities or to demonstrate non-interference, with functionalities to unroll process behaviors up to five times and print counterexamples for detailed analysis.

assistant :: module process1
{
  type pc_t = enum { A };

  var pc : pc_t;
  input s : boolean; // secret input
  input x : boolean; // public input
  output z: boolean; // public output

  init {
    pc = A;
    z = false;
  }

  next {
    z' = !x;
  }

}

module process2
{
  type pc_t = enum { B, C };

  var pc : pc_t;
  input s : boolean; // secret input
  input x : boolean; // public input
  output z: boolean; // public output

  procedure next_state()
    modifies z;
    modifies pc;
  {
    case
      (pc == B) && s && !x : { pc = C; z = true; }
      (pc == C) && s && !x : { pc = B; z = false; }
    esac
  }

  init {
    pc = B;
    z = false;
  }

  next {
    call next_state();

}


module main

====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
You may recall the puzzle of a ferryman, goat, cabbage, and wolf all on one side of a river. The ferryman can cross the river with at most one passenger in his boat. There is a behavioural conflict between:
1. the goat and the cabbage; and
2. the goat and the wolf;
if they are on the same river bank but the ferryman crosses the river or stays on the other bank.

We wish to know how the ferryman can transport all goods to the other side, without any conflicts occurring.

Build a model in which the states represent which goods are at which side of the river. Your model will need to have variables representing the location of the ferryman, the goat, the cabbage and the wolf and a variable that indicates what is being carried in the ferry.

Define a goal state in which all goods are on the other side of the river. Write a property which checks whether this goal state is reachable without any conflicts occurring.

Use the variable names ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf and carry.

====================
assistant :: module ferryman
{
  type loc_t = enum { left, right };

  var ferryman, goat, cabbage, wolf : loc_t;
  var carry : enum { empty, goat, cabbage, wolf };

  init {
    ferryman = left;
    goat = left;
    cabbage = left;
    wolf = left;
    carry = empty;
  }

  transition {
    case
      (ferryman == left) && (goat == left) && (cabbage == left) && (wolf == left) && (carry == empty) : {
        // ferryman takes the goat
        ferryman' = right;
        goat' = right;
        carry' = goat;
      }
      (ferryman == right) && (goat == right) && (cabbage == left) && (wolf == left) && (carry == goat) : {
        // ferryman takes the cabbage
        ferryman' = left;
        cabbage' = right;
        carry' = cabbage;
      }
      (ferryman == left) && (goat == right) && (cabbage == right) && (wolf == left) && (carry == cabbage) : {
        // ferryman takes the wolf
        ferryman' = right;
        wolf' = right;
        carry' = wolf;
      }
      (ferryman == right) && (goat == right) && (cabbage == right) && (wolf == right) && (carry == wolf) : {
        // ferryman takes the goat
        ferryman' = left;
        goat' = left;
        carry' = goat;
      }
    esac
  }

  property no_conflict : {
    always(no_conflict)
  }

  goal {
    goat == right;
    cabbage == right;
    wolf == right;
  }
}
