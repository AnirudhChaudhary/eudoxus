```ucl
module main {
  type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };

  var current_state : state_t;

  init {
    current_state = RED;
  }

  next {
    current_state = 
      if (current_state = RED) then GREEN
      else RED;
  }

  // Safety property to check: The light should not be RED and GREEN at the same time.
  property mutual_exclusion {
    !(current_state = RED & current_state = GREEN);
  }

  control {
    if (current_state == RED) { print "Red Light"; }
    else if (current_state == GREEN) { print "Green Light"; }
  }
}
```

This revised UCLID5 code addresses the syntax issues found in the original version. It uses the correct enumeration type declaration, switches to `if-else` for state transitions, fixes the logical expression in the property, and adjusts the `control` block for appropriate comparisons using `==`.
