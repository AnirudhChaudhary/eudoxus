This version of the UCLID5 code corrects the syntax errors by replacing logical '&&' operators with '&' and logical '||' operators with '|'. Additionally, cases in 'next' require arrows '->' to associate conditions with actions, and parenthesis around conditions in 'if' statements have also been corrected.
