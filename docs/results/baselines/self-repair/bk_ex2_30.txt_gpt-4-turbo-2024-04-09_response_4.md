In this corrected version, I enclosed the entire machine configuration and logic within the `module main {..}` scope, which is required for the correct definition of models in UCLID5. The `state_t`s `in` has been renamed to `in_state` to avoid reserved keyword collision. Transition rules were placed under `next` rather than `transition`. Assignment operators are also changed to `:=` instead of `=` for initialization and transitioning in UCLID5.
