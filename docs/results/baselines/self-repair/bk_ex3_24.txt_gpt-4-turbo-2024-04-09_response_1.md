Explanation:
- The machine manages two variables `coin` and `dispensed_drinks` to keep track of the count of coins inserted and the number of drinks dispensed.
- In the `init` block, both `coin` and `dispensed_drinks` are initialized to 0.
- Transitions for `coin`: the machine accepts additional coins until it reaches an illustrative limit (say 10 coins), beyond which no more coins are accepted.
- Transitions for `dispensed_drinks`: a drink is dispensed only if there are enough coins; otherwise, the number of dispensed drinks remains the same.
- The safety invariant ensures that the number of dispensed drinks never exceeds the number of coins inserted into the machine.
