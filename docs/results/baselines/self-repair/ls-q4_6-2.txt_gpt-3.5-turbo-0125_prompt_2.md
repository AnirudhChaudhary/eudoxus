Fix the following UCLID5 code using the compiler feedback provided below.

```

(define-state warn bool)
(define-state nowarn bool)
(define-state time int)
(define-state ignition bool)
(define-state buckled bool)

(define-inits
  (=> (and (not ignition) (and (not warn) nowarn)) (make initialize))

(define-transitions
  (=> (and (not ignition) (not warn) (not nowarn)) (make warn))
  (=> (and (ignition) (not warn) (nowarn)) 
      (when (not (or (> time 30) buckled))
          (make (+ time 1)))
      (when (or (> time 30) buckled)
          (make nowarn)))

(define-outputs
  (=> warn (make redLight true) (make beeper true))
  (=> nowarn (make redLight false) (make beeper false)))

(define-events
  (when (and ignition (not buckled)) (make warn))
  (when (and ignition buckled) (make nowarn))
  (when (and (not ignition) buckled) (make nowarn))
  (when (and ignition (not warn) nowarn) (make noWarn)))
```

Compiler feedback:

```
Syntax error on tmp.ucl, line 2: end of input expected.
(define-state warn bool)

```
Reply with your UCLID5 code inside one unique code block.

I can definitely do that! Here is the UCLID5 code:
