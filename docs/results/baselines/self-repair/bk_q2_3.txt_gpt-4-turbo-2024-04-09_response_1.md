This UCLID5 model sets up traffic control at a four-way intersection, where traffic lights move through the states green, yellow, red, and amber sequentially but subject to specific control logic. The `next_light_state` function dictates the transition from one light state to the next.

The `next` section then ensures that the lights L1 and L3 start green together after they have gone through their red and amber phases respectively, followed by a sequence where L2 and then L4 go green, not at the same time as their opposing lights. Traffic lights' states are switched in a sequenced manner ensuring that they are never both green to avoid traffic conflicts, especially in cross traffic.
