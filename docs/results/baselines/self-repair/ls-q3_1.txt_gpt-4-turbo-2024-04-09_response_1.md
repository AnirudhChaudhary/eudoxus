    // Specification to ensure that the count increments properly above the threshold

```
This UCLID5 code defines a model for an event counter that increments a count whenever the temperature exceeds a specified threshold. The `temp` and `count` variables represent the current temperature and the current count, respectively. The `next` functions define how these variables change over time. The `property` specifies that the count should only increment when the temperature is above the threshold, ensuring the counter behaves correctly.
