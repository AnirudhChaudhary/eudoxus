  // Declare the variables with their respective types
  var request : boolean;
  var status : status_t;

  property liveness_property = [](request -> <>ever_busy);

  // Add control statements for execution

This UCLID5 code defines a simple module to simulate a system where a request triggers a change in status from 'ready' to 'busy'. It uses a safety property to ensure that when a request is made, status will eventually be set to busy. An auxiliary variable, `ever_busy`, assists in confirming this in the liveness property. The `<>` operator exemplifies the "eventually" operator in temporal logic, ensuring that a condition holds true at some point in the future.
