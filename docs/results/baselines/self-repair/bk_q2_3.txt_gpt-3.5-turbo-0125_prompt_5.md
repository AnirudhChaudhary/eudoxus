Fix the following UCLID5 code using the compiler feedback provided below.

```

enum Color = {green, yellow, red};

C : contr[
  step1 : (L1 = green) & (L3 = green) & (L2 = green) & (L4 = green) -> (L1 = yellow) & (L3 = yellow);
  step2 : (L1 = yellow) & (L3 = yellow) -> (L1 = red) & (L3 = red) & (L2 = green);
  step3 : (L2 = green) -> (L2 = yellow);
  step4 : (L2 = yellow) -> (L2 = red) & (L4 = green);
  step5 : (L4 = green) -> (L4 = yellow);
  step6 : (L4 = yellow) -> (L4 = red) & (L1 = green) & (L3 = green);
];
```

Compiler feedback:

```
Syntax error on tmp.ucl, line 2: end of input expected.
enum Color = {green, yellow, red};
