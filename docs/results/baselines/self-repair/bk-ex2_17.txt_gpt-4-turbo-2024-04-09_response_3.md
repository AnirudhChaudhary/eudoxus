```module main {
  type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };

  var current_state : state_t;

  init {
    current_state = RED;
  }

  next {
    current_state = 
      if (current_state == RED) then GREEN
      else RED;
  }

  // Safety property to check: The light should not be RED and GREEN at the same time.
  property mutual_exclusion {
    !(current_state == RED && current_state == GREEN);
  }

  control {
    if (current_state == RED) { print "Red Light"; }
    else if (current_state == GREEN) { print "Green Light"; }
  }
}
```
Explanation:
- Fixed the syntax for the equality check in the `next` block and the `mutual_exclusion` property using `==` instead of `=`.
- Adjusted the logical AND operator in the property definition to use `&&` instead of `&` for clarity and standard use.
- These corrections align the code with typical UCLID5 syntax rules and should resolve the syntax errors reported by the compiler.
