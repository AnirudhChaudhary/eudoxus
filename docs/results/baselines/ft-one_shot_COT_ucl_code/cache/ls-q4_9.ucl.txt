user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To develop a UCLID5 model for the traffic light system at the intersection of Main and Secondary streets, we need to define the behavior of the traffic lights based on the described operational rules and safety requirements. Hereâ€™s a structured outline for the UCLID5 model:

### 1. Model Setup
- **Constants and Enumerations**: Define the duration of each light phase and other constants like the yellow light duration (5 seconds).
- **State Variables**: Define state variables to represent the current state of each traffic light (`mState` for Main street and `sState` for Secondary street). These states could be `Green`, `Yellow`, and `Red`.
- **Input Variables**: Define a boolean input variable `vehicleDetected` to indicate the presence of a vehicle on the Secondary street.

### 2. Initialization
- **Initial State**: Set the initial state of the traffic lights where `mState` is `Green` and `sState` is `Red`.

### 3. State Transition
- **Main Module Logic**:
  - Define transitions for the Main light (`mState`) and Secondary light (`sState`) based on the current state and the `vehicleDetected` input.
  - Main light transitions:
    - From `Green` to `Yellow` if `vehicleDetected` is `true` or the green phase duration expires.
    - From `Yellow` to `Red` after the yellow phase duration.
    - From `Red` to `Green` after the red phase duration.
  - Secondary light transitions:
    - From `Red` to `Green` if the Main light transitions to `Red`.
    - From `Green` to `Yellow` after the green phase duration.
    - From `Yellow` to `Red` after the yellow phase duration.

### 4. Safety Properties
- **Non-Interference Requirement**: Assert that when one light is in its `Green` or `Yellow` phase, the other must be in the `Red` phase. This can be modeled as an invariant in UCLID5.

### 5. Output Logic
- **Output Signals**: Define how the output signals (`mG`, `mY`, `mR`, `sG`, `sY`, `sR`) are determined based on the state variables. For example:
  - `mG` is `true` when `mState` is `Green`, otherwise `false`.
  - `mY` is `true` when `mState` is `Yellow`, otherwise `false`.
  - `mR` is `true` when `mState` is `Red`, otherwise `false`.
  - Similarly define `sG`, `sY`, `sR` based on `sState`.

### 6. Simulation and Verification
- **Bounded Model Checking**: Use bounded model checking to verify the safety properties and correct behavior of the traffic light system over a sequence of cycles.
- **Counterexamples**: Generate counterexamples if the safety properties are violated.

### 7. Control and Command Functions
- **Control Flow**: Implement control structures to simulate the traffic light system operation, taking into account the vehicle detection and the specified durations for each light phase.

This outline provides a structured approach to modeling the described traffic light system in UCLID5, ensuring that the model meets the operational requirements and safety constraints as specified.
