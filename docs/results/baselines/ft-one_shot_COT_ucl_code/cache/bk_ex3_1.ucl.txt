====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the parallel composition of two traffic light systems at intersection roads using UCLID5, we'll define the behavior of each traffic light and then synchronize their actions to check for potential deadlocks. Here's an outline of how to structure the UCLID5 model:

--OUTLINE--

### Model Components:
1. **Type Definitions**:
   Define the states of the traffic lights using an enumerated type for clarity.
   ```scala
   type state_t = {RED, GREEN};
   ```

2. **Global Variables**:
   Declare the state variables for each traffic light.
   ```scala
   var traffic_light1 : state_t;
   var traffic_light2 : state_t;
   ```

3. **Initialization**:
   Initialize the traffic lights to ensure they start in a valid state configuration.
   ```scala
   init {
     traffic_light1 = RED;
     traffic_light2 = GREEN;
   }
   ```

4. **Transition Relation**:
   Define the transition relation for the traffic lights, detailing how they change states based on actions A and B.
   ```scala
   next(traffic_light1) :=
     case
       traffic_light1 == RED && action_A : GREEN;
       traffic_light1 == GREEN && action_B : RED;
       true : traffic_light1;
     esac;

   next(traffic_light2) :=
     case
       traffic_light2 == GREEN && action_A : RED;
       traffic_light2 == RED && action_B : GREEN;
       true : traffic_light2;
     esac;
   ```

5. **Actions**:
   Define the actions that trigger state changes. These actions are synchronized across both traffic lights.
   ```scala
   input action_A : boolean;
   input action_B : boolean;
   ```

6. **Safety Property**:
   Define a safety property to check for deadlocks. In this context, a deadlock would mean that both traffic lights are stuck in the same state without the possibility of transition.
   ```scala
   invariant no_deadlock : !(traffic_light1 == RED && traffic_light2 == RED) && !(traffic_light1 == GREEN && traffic_light2 == GREEN);
   ```

7. **Control Block**:
   Use the control block to specify model checking procedures, particularly focusing on deadlock detection.
   ```scala
   control {
     check;
     print_results;
   }
   ```

### Analysis:
- The model initializes the traffic lights in opposite states (one RED, one GREEN).
- Actions A and B are defined to synchronize the state transitions:
  - **Action A**: Traffic light 1 goes from RED to GREEN, and Traffic light 2 goes from GREEN to RED.
  - **Action B**: Traffic light 1 goes from GREEN to RED, and Traffic light 2 goes from RED to GREEN.
- The safety property ensures there are no states where both traffic lights are RED or both are GREEN at the same time, which would indicate a deadlock.
- The model checking process will verify whether this property holds under all possible sequences of actions.

This UCLID5 model effectively simulates the behavior of two synchronized traffic lights at an intersection, ensuring that the system is free from deadlocks under the defined transitions.
====================
assistant :: // Two traffic lights at an intersection
module traffic_lights
{
    type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };
    var traffic_light1 : state_t;
    var traffic_light2 : state_t;

    init {
        traffic_light1 = RED;
        traffic_light2 = GREEN;
    }

    next {
        case
        traffic_light1' = GREEN;
        traffic_light2' = RED;
        traffic_light1' = RED;
        traffic_light2' = GREEN;
        esac
    }

    input action_A : boolean;
    input action_B : boolean;

    invariant no_deadlock : !(traffic_light1 == RED && traffic_light2 == RED) && !(traffic_light1 == GREEN && traffic_light2 == GREEN);

    control {
        check;
        print_results;
    }
}
