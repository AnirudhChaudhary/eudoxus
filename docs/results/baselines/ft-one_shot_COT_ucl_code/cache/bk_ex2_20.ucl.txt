====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Sure, let's outline a UCLID5 model for the given parallel program where two actions, A and B, manipulate the shared variable `x` concurrently. We'll model this as a transition system where each action can be represented as a transition.

--OUTLINE--

**Model Overview:**
This model represents a simple concurrent system where two actions, A (`x := 2*x`) and B (`x := x + 1`), operate on a shared variable `x`. The model will simulate the interleaving of these actions to explore the possible values of `x` after both actions have been applied.

**Variables:**
- Shared variable `x` of type `int`.

**Initial State:**
- `x` is initialized to 3.

**Transitions:**
Two transitions will be defined representing the actions A and B:
1. **Action A**: This action doubles the value of `x`.
2. **Action B**: This action increments the value of `x` by 1.

**Interleaving of Actions:**
To simulate the concurrent execution of A and B, we will model interleavings explicitly:
- Possible interleavings: A followed by B, and B followed by A.
- These interleavings will be represented as sequences of transitions in the model.

**Safety Properties:**
- We might want to check certain properties such as whether `x` reaches a specific value after the execution of both actions.

**Model Checking:**
- Use UCLID5's capabilities to perform bounded model checking to explore all possible states resulting from different interleavings of A and B.

**UCLID5 Model Components:**
1. **Variables Declaration:**
   ```plaintext
   var x : int;
   ```

2. **Initialization:**
   ```plaintext
   init {
     x = 3;
   }
   ```

3. **Transitions:**
   ```plaintext
   next(x) :=
     case
       // Action A
       is_action_A : 2 * x;
       // Action B
       is_action_B : x + 1;
       // Default case to handle stability when no actions are taken
       TRUE : x;
     esac;
   ```

4. **Control Logic:**
   - Define boolean flags `is_action_A` and `is_action_B` to control which action is taken in a state.
   - These flags help in simulating the interleaving by controlling the order of action application.

5. **Safety Properties:**
   ```plaintext
   invariant prop1 : (x >= 3);
   ```

6. **Model Checking:**
   - Specify the number of steps to unroll in the bounded model checking process to explore all interleavings up to a certain depth.

7. **Counterexample Tracing:**
   - Use UCLID5's trace generation feature to observe the sequence of values `x` takes for different interleavings.

This outline provides a basic structure for building the UCLID5 model to simulate and analyze the given parallel program with shared variable manipulation.
