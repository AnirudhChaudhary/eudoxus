system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To outline a UCLID5 model for a stack of nonnegative integers with a fixed capacity `n`, we'll consider a transition system representation. The model will include operations such as `top`, `pop`, and `push`, and it will abstract from specific values, focusing instead on the operation behaviors and constraints due to the stack's capacity.

--OUTLINE--

### 1. Type Definitions:
   - Define a type `stack_t` as an array of nonnegative integers with a fixed size `n`. This type will represent the stack.
   - Define a type for the index which could be an integer ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

### 2. State Variables:
   - `s`: An array of integers representing the stack.
   - `top_index`: An integer indicating the current top index of the stack. This will help manage the `top`, `pop`, and `push` operations.

### 3. Initialization:
   - Initialize `s` with all elements set to some default value (e.g., 0 or a special value indicating an empty position).
   - Set `top_index` to -1 indicating that the stack is initially empty.

### 4. Transition Relations:
   - **Push Operation**:
     - Input: `value` (a nonnegative integer to be pushed onto the stack).
     - Condition: Ensure that the stack is not full (`top_index < n - 1`).
     - Effect: Increment `top_index` and set `s[top_index]` to `value`.
   - **Pop Operation**:
     - Condition: Ensure that the stack is not empty (`top_index >= 0`).
     - Effect: Decrement `top_index`.
   - **Top Operation**:
     - Output: Return `s[top_index]`.
     - Condition: Ensure that the stack is not empty (`top_index >= 0`).

### 5. Safety Properties:
   - Check that `top_index` never exceeds `n-1` (stack overflow).
   - Check that `top_index` never goes below -1 (stack underflow).
   - Optionally, verify that a pop operation on an empty stack does not change `top_index`.

### 6. Invariants:
   - `top_index` should always be between -1 and `n-1`.
   - After a `push` operation, `top_index` should increase by 1, unless the stack is full.
   - After a `pop` operation, `top_index` should decrease by 1, unless the stack is empty.

### 7. Control:
   - The model may include control blocks for bounded model checking to verify the safety properties and invariants.
   - Define scenarios for testing typical stack operations, ensuring they comply with expected behaviors (e.g., pushing until full, popping until empty).

### 8. Counterexamples:
   - Provide counterexamples for scenarios where safety properties are violated (e.g., attempting to push onto a full stack or pop from an empty stack).

This model abstracts from specific stack values and focuses on the operations and their effects on the stack's state, ensuring that all operations respect the stack's capacity constraints and that the stack's behavior is consistent with typical stack operations.

            }

    // stack underflow
    property (top_index >= -1);
    // pop on empty stack does not change top_index
    property (top_index == -1 || next(top_index) != -1);

    // invariants
    invariant (top_index >= -1 && top_index <= n-1);
    invariant (top_index == -1 || next(top_index) == -1 || next(top_index) == top_index + 1);
    invariant (top_index == -1 || next(top_index) == -1 || next(top_index) == top_index - 1);

    control
    {
        // push until full
        push_until_full = bmc(1);
        check;
        push_until_full.print_cex(s, top_index);
        // pop until empty
        pop_until_empty = bmc(1);
        check;
        pop_until_empty.print_cex(s, top_index);
    }
