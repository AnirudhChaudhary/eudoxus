system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the Alternating Bit Protocol (ABP) in UCLID5, we'll break down the system into its core components: the sender, the receiver, the message channel, and the acknowledgement channel. We'll also define the states and transitions for each component, and specify properties to verify that the protocol behaves as expected.

### Model Outline

#### 1. **Type Definitions**
   - Define types for the states of the sender, receiver, and channels.
   - Define the message type which includes a payload and a control bit.

#### 2. **Global Variables**
   - `st` (sender state): State of the sender.
   - `message1` (message channel): Stores the message being sent from the sender to the receiver.
   - `message2` (acknowledgement channel): Stores the acknowledgement message from the receiver to the sender.
   - `ack` (receiver state): State of the receiver.

#### 3. **Sender Module**
   - States: `WAIT_FOR_ACK_0`, `WAIT_FOR_ACK_1`.
   - Transitions based on the current state and the acknowledgement received.
   - Output: Updates `message1` based on the state and retransmits if the expected acknowledgement isn't received.

#### 4. **Receiver Module**
   - States: `EXPECT_BIT_0`, `EXPECT_BIT_1`.
   - Transitions based on the received message.
   - Output: Updates `message2` with the correct acknowledgement based on the control bit of the received message.

#### 5. **Message Channel Module**
   - Simulates possible loss or duplication of messages.
   - Transitions: Non-deterministic choice to either deliver the message, lose it, or duplicate it.

#### 6. **Acknowledgement Channel Module**
   - Similar to the Message Channel Module, but for acknowledgements.

#### 7. **Main Module**
   - Initializes the system.
   - Orchestrates the interaction between sender, receiver, and channels.
   - Specifies the initial conditions and triggers the state transitions.

#### 8. **Properties to Verify**
   - **Safety Property**: The receiver should only accept messages with the expected control bit.
   - **Liveness Property**: If the sender continually re-sends a message, it eventually gets acknowledged (assuming the channel does not lose infinitely many messages).
   - **Validity Property**: If a message is sent with a particular control bit, then the next message received by the receiver should have the alternating bit, unless lost.

### UCLID5 Model Example

```uclid
module main {
    type state_t = enum { WAIT_FOR_ACK_0, WAIT_FOR_ACK_1 };
    type ack_state_t = enum { EXPECT_BIT_0, EXPECT_BIT_1 };
    type message_t = { bit: boolean, payload: int };
    type channel_message_t = union { none, one_message: message_t, duplicate: (message_t, message_t) };

    var st : state_t;
    var ack : ack_state_t;
    var message1 : channel_message_t;
    var message2 : channel_message_t;

    // Define the sender behavior
    procedure sender() {
        if (st == WAIT_FOR_ACK_0) {
            if (message2 has one_message && message2.one_message.bit == false) {
                st := WAIT_FOR_ACK_1;
                message1 := {bit: true, payload: new_payload()};
            } else {
                // re-send the message
                message1 := {bit: false, payload: current_payload()};
            }
        } else if (st == WAIT_FOR_ACK_1) {
            if (message2 has one_message && message2.one_message.bit == true) {
                st := WAIT_FOR_ACK_0;
                message1 := {bit: false, payload: new_payload()};
            } else {
                // re-send the message
                message1 := {bit: true, payload: current_payload()};
            }
        }
    }

    // Define the receiver behavior
    procedure receiver() {
        match (message1) {
            case none => { /* do nothing */ }
            case one_message(m) => {
                if (ack == EXPECT_BIT_0 && m.bit == false) {
                    message2 := {bit: false, payload: 1}; // Acknowledge receipt
                    ack := EXPECT_BIT_1;
                } else if (ack == EXPECT_BIT_1 && m.bit == true) {
                    message2 := {bit: true, payload: 1};
                    ack := EXPECT_BIT_0;
                }
            }
            case duplicate(m1, m2) => {
                // Handle duplication case, e.g., ignore or process based on system requirements
            }
        }
    }

    init {
        st := WAIT_FOR_ACK_0;
        ack := EXPECT_BIT_0;
        message1 := {none};
        message2 := {none};
    }

    next {
        sender();
        receiver();
    }

    control {
        check;
        print_results;
    }
}
```

This model sets up the basic structure and behavior of the ABP. The actual implementation might need adjustments based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system being modeled. The properties mentioned should be formally specified and verified using UCLID5's verification capabilities.
