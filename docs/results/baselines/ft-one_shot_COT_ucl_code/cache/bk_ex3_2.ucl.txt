system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Certainly! To model the classic dining philosophers problem in UCLID5, we'll need to represent the philosophers and chopsticks as variables and define the transitions associated with the actions of thinking, waiting, and eating. We'll also define a property to check for possible deadlock scenarios.

--OUTLINE--

### Model Components

1. **State Variables:**
   - Philosophers: `phil1`, `phil2`, `phil3`, `phil4`, `phil5`. Each philosopher can be in one of three states: `thinking`, `waiting`, or `eating`.
   - Chopsticks: `chopstick1`, `chopstick2`, `chopstick3`, `chopstick4`, `chopstick5`. Each chopstick can be either `available` or `in_use`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - All philosophers start in the `thinking` state.
   - All chopsticks are `available`.

3. **Transitions:**
   - **Thinking to Waiting:** A philosopher transitions from `thinking` to `waiting` when they decide to eat.
   - **Waiting to Eating:** A philosopher can transition from `waiting` to `eating` if both chopsticks to their left and right are `available`. Upon this transition, both chopsticks are set to `in_use`.
   - **Eating to Thinking:** After eating, a philosopher goes back to `thinking`, and both chopsticks used are set back to `available`.

4. **State Transition System:**
   - Define transitions for each philosopher based on their current state and the availability of their left and right chopsticks.
   - For example, for `phil1`, the left chopstick is `chopstick5` and the right chopstick is `chopstick1`.

### Properties

- **Deadlock Detection:**
  - Deadlock occurs if all philosophers are in the `waiting` state, which means none can transition to `eating` because each philosopher is waiting for a chopstick that is held by another.
  - Property to check: `deadlock_possible` which evaluates to true if all philosophers are in the `waiting` state.

### UCLID5 Model Outline

1. **Type Definitions:**
   - Define enumerated types for philosopher states (`{thinking, waiting, eating}`) and chopstick states (`{available, in_use}`).

2. **Variable Declarations:**
   - Declare philosopher and chopstick variables using the defined types.

3. **Initial State Specification:**
   - Set initial states for all philosophers and chopsticks.

4. **Transition Relations:**
   - Specify conditions under which philosophers and chopsticks change their states.

5. **Safety Property:**
   - Define the `deadlock_possible` property to detect if all philosophers are simultaneously in the `waiting` state.

6. **Control Block:**
   - Use UCLID5's control block to check the property for deadlock using bounded model checking or other verification techniques.

This model will allow us to verify whether the dining philosophers problem, as configured, can enter a deadlock state, which is critical for understanding synchronization and resource allocation issues in concurrent systems.
