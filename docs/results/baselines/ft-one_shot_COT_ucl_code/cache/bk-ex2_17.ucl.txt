system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Certainly! Below is an outline for a UCLID5 model of a traffic light system that transitions between two states: red and green. This model helps to understand the basic operation of a traffic light control system using state transition modeling.

--OUTLINE--

**Model Components**:
1. **State Enumeration**:
   - Define an enumerated type `light_state_t` representing the states of the traffic light. This type will have two values: `RED` and `GREEN`.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `current_state`: A variable of type `light_state_t` to hold the current state of the traffic light.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `current_state` to `RED` indicating that the traffic light starts in the red state.

4. **Transitions**:
   - Define a transition system where the traffic light toggles between `RED` and `GREEN`.
   - When `current_state` is `RED`, it should transition to `GREEN` in the next state.
   - When `current_state` is `GREEN`, it should transition back to `RED`.

5. **Safety Properties**:
   - You might want to specify safety properties such as the traffic light should never be in both `RED` and `GREEN` states at the same time.

6. **Control Logic**:
   - This will be used to simulate and verify the model. The control logic can include commands for model checking and simulating the traffic light transitions over several cycles.

**Detailed UCLID5 Components**:

1. **Type Definitions**:
   ```uclid
   type light_state_t = enum { RED, GREEN };
   ```

2. **State Variable Declarations**:
   ```uclid
   var current_state : light_state_t;
   ```

3. **Initialization**:
   ```uclid
   init(current_state == RED);
   ```

4. **Transition Relation**:
   ```uclid
   next(current_state) :=
     if (current_state == RED) then GREEN
     else RED;
   ```

5. **Safety Properties**:
   ```uclid
   invariant "no_concurrent_states" : (current_state == RED) -> (current_state != GREEN);
   ```

6. **Control Logic for Simulation and Verification**:
   ```uclid
   control {
     // Specify the number of steps to simulate
     simulate 10;
     // Specify the model checking engine and properties to check
     check;
     print_results;
   }
   ```

This outline provides a basic model of a traffic light system in UCLID5. The model can be extended with more features such as timing constraints, additional states (like yellow), or integration into a larger traffic management system.
