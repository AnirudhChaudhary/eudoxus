====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model the described automobile feature in UCLID5, we will need to define the behavior of the system based on the state of the engine, seat belt sensors, and a timer. Below is an outline for the UCLID5 model:

--OUTLINE--

### Model Overview:
The model simulates the behavior of a warning system in a car that uses sensors to detect if passengers have not buckled their seat belts once the engine is started. The system includes a beeper and a red warning light, which are activated under specific conditions and deactivated accordingly.

### Definitions and Variables:
1. **State Variables:**
   - `ignition`: Boolean variable indicating whether the engine is turned on (`true`) or off (`false`).
   - `buckled`: Boolean variable indicating whether the seat belt is buckled (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - `time`: Integer variable representing the time in seconds since the warning was activated.
   - `beeper`: Boolean variable indicating whether the beeper is active (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - `warning_light`: Boolean variable indicating whether the warning light is active (`true`) or not (`false`).

2. **Events:**
   - `warn`: Event triggered when the ignition is turned on and there is at least one unbuckled seat belt, or when a passenger sits in a seat and does not buckle up.
   - `noWarn`: Event triggered when all passengers have buckled up, a passenger leaves a seat, or the ignition is turned off.

### Initialization:
- Set `ignition` to `false`, `buckled` to `false`, `time` to `0`, `beeper` to `false`, and `warning_light` to `false`.

### Transitions:
1. **Ignition Turned On (`ignition` becomes `true`):**
   - Check seat belts:
     - If `buckled` is `false`, trigger `warn`.
     - Else, do nothing.

2. **Warn Event (`warn`):**
   - Activate `beeper` and `warning_light`.
   - Reset `time` to `0`.

3. **NoWarn Event (`noWarn`):**
   - Deactivate `beeper` and `warning_light`.
   - Reset `time` to `0`.

4. **Timer Increment:**
   - If `beeper` is `true`, increment `time` by 1 each second.
   - If `time` reaches 30 seconds, deactivate `beeper`.

5. **Seat Belt Buckled (`buckled` becomes `true`):**
   - Trigger `noWarn`.

6. **Ignition Turned Off (`ignition` becomes `false`):**
   - Trigger `noWarn`.

### Invariants:
- The `warning_light` should be `true` if and only if `buckled` is `false` and `ignition` is `true`.
- The `beeper` should be `false` if `time` is 30 seconds or `buckled` is `true`.

### Control Block:
- The model should allow for simulation and bounded model checking to verify the correctness of the warning system behavior.
- Potential scenarios to test include turning the ignition on with unbuckled seat belts, buckling the seat belts after the warning has started, and turning the ignition off.

This outline provides a structured approach to model the described automobile feature in UCLID5, focusing on the interactions and dependencies between the system's components and their states.

    invariant beeper_invariant_2 : (time == 30 || buckled) ==> (beeper == false);
