system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To model a thermostat with hysteresis in UCLID5, we will create a model that captures the behavior of the thermostat as it regulates temperature around a setpoint with a hysteresis margin. We'll define a simple state machine with two states for heating and cooling, and manage transitions based on the current temperature.

--OUTLINE--

**1. Model Definition:**
- The thermostat model will include:
  - States for heating and cooling.
  - Input for the current temperature.
  - Outputs to signal whether to turn the heater on or off.

**2. State Definition:**
- We will use an enumerated type `state_t` with two states:
  - `HEATING`: The state where the heater is on.
  - `COOLING`: The state where the heater is off.

**3. Variables:**
- `temp`: A real number representing the current temperature.
- `heatOn`: A boolean output that signals turning the heater on.
- `heatOff`: A boolean output that signals turning the heater off.
- `current_state`: A variable of type `state_t` representing the current state of the thermostat.

**4. Initialization:**
- Initialize `current_state` to `COOLING` (assuming the system starts without heating).
- Initialize `heatOn` and `heatOff` to `false`.

**5. Transition Function:**
- Define a function `transition` that updates `current_state` based on `temp` and the current state:
  - If `current_state` is `COOLING` and `temp` drops to 18 degrees or lower, set `current_state` to `HEATING` and `heatOn` to `true`.
  - If `current_state` is `HEATING` and `temp` rises to 22 degrees or higher, set `current_state` to `COOLING` and `heatOff` to `true`.
  - Ensure `heatOn` and `heatOff` are reset to `false` at the end of each transition to prevent continuous signals.

**6. Main Module:**
- In the main module, instantiate the thermostat.
- Use an input variable to simulate changes in `temp`.
- Use assertions to check the correctness of state transitions and output signals.
- Optionally, use a sequence of temperatures to simulate the thermostat's response over time.

**7. Safety Properties:**
- Assert that the heater cannot be on when `current_state` is `COOLING`.
- Assert that the heater cannot be off when `current_state` is `HEATING`.
- Assert that `heatOn` and `heatOff` are mutually exclusive.

**8. Simulation and Verification:**
- Use UCLID5's simulation capabilities to test the thermostat model with different temperature scenarios.
- Verify that the system maintains the temperature within the hysteresis range around the setpoint (20 degrees Celsius).

**9. Counterexamples and Debugging:**
- Utilize UCLID5's counterexample generation feature to find scenarios where the model fails to maintain the temperature correctly.
- Debug and refine the model based on these findings.

This outline provides a structured approach to modeling a thermostat with hysteresis in UCLID5, ensuring that the system behaves correctly under varying temperature conditions and conforms to the specified hysteresis behavior.

        heatOff = false;

    }

    next {
        temp' = temp_seq[0];
        next (t);
        assert (current_state == COOLING) ==> !heatOn;
        assert (current_state == HEATING) ==> !heatOff;
        assert (!heatOn || !heatOff);
