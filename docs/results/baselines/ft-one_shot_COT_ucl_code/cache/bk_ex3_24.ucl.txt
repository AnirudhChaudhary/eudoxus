user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Here is a structured outline for modeling a beverage vending machine in UCLID5, which dispenses drinks upon receiving coins and checks a safety property regarding the relationship between inserted coins and dispensed drinks:

--OUTLINE--

Model Overview:
This UCLID5 model simulates a simple beverage vending machine system. The system accepts coins, and in return, dispenses drinks. A safety property ensures that the machine never dispenses more drinks than the number of coins it has received.

1. **Model Variables**:
   - `coin`: An integer variable that counts the total number of coins inserted into the vending machine.
   - `dispensed_drinks`: An integer variable that counts the number of drinks dispensed by the machine.
   - `request_drink`: A boolean input that triggers the dispensing process when set to `true`.
   - `coin_inserted`: A boolean input that indicates the insertion of a coin when set to `true`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - Initially, both `coin` and `dispensed_drinks` are set to 0, representing an empty state of the vending machine.

3. **State Transition System**:
   - The system transitions are governed by the inputs `coin_inserted` and `request_drink`.
   - When a coin is inserted (`coin_inserted` is `true`), the `coin` variable is incremented.
   - When a drink is requested (`request_drink` is `true`), the machine checks if there are enough coins (i.e., `coin > dispensed_drinks`). If the condition is met, `dispensed_drinks` is incremented, representing the dispensing of a drink.

4. **Safety Property**:
   - A key safety property to verify is that the number of dispensed drinks never exceeds the number of coins inserted. This is expressed as an invariant:
     ```uclid
     assert(coin >= dispensed_drinks);
     ```
   - This invariant must hold in every state of the system to ensure the machine operates within safe operational limits.

5. **Auxiliary Variables**:
   - While the basic model does not require auxiliary variables beyond `coin` and `dispensed_drinks`, additional variables like `machine_state` (to track different operational states of the machine) or `error_state` (to handle errors such as attempting to dispense a drink without enough coins) could be added for more complex behaviors.

6. **Model Checking**:
   - The model will utilize UCLID5's capabilities for bounded model checking to systematically explore all possible states up to a certain bound to verify the safety property.
   - The `control` block can specify the depth of the state space exploration and can be adjusted based on the complexity of the model and the computational resources available.

7. **Counterexamples**:
   - If the model checker finds a violation of the safety property, it will generate a counterexample. This counterexample will provide a sequence of inputs and state transitions showing how the vending machine can dispense more drinks than the coins inserted, which helps in debugging and refining the model.

This structured approach will aid in developing a formal model of a vending machine in UCLID5, ensuring that the system adheres to the specified safety property and behaves as expected under all conditions.
====================
assistant :: module vending_machine {

    var coin : integer;
    var dispensed_drinks : integer;

    input request_drink : boolean;
    input coin_inserted : boolean;

    init {
        coin = 0;
        dispensed_drinks = 0;
    }

    next {
        if (coin_inserted) {
            coin' = coin + 1;
        }
        if (request_drink && coin > dispensed_drinks) {
            dispensed_drinks' = dispensed_drinks + 1;
        }
    }

    // Safety property.
    assert(coin >= dispensed_drinks);

    // No error.
}

control {
    // Check safety property with up to 5 unrollings.
    // If the safety property is violated, print a counterexample.
    check;
    v = print_cex(request_drink, coin_inserted, coin, dispensed_drinks);
}
