system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To outline a UCLID5 model for the described traffic light state machine, we'll break down the model into several parts, including type definitions, state variables, initialization, state transitions, and outputs. Here's how you might structure this model:

--OUTLINE--

**1. Type Definitions:**
   - Define an enumerated type for the states of the traffic light (`red`, `green`, `yellow`, `pending`).

```uclid
type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN, YELLOW, PENDING };
```

**2. State Variables:**
   - `current_state`: of type `state_t` to hold the current state of the traffic light.
   - `count`: an integer to count seconds within each state.
   - `pedestrian`: a boolean input that indicates whether a pedestrian has pressed the walk button.

```uclid
var current_state : state_t;
var count : int;
input pedestrian : boolean;
```

**3. Initialization:**
   - Initialize the traffic light in the `RED` state and set `count` to 0.

```uclid
init {
    current_state = RED;
    count = 0;
}
```

**4. State Transitions:**
   - Define the transitions based on the current state, the value of `count`, and the `pedestrian` input.

```uclid
next(count) := if (current_state == GREEN && pedestrian && count >= 60) || current_state == YELLOW then 0 else count + 1;

next(current_state) :=
    case
        current_state == RED && count == 60 : GREEN;
        current_state == GREEN && pedestrian && count >= 60 : PENDING;
        current_state == PENDING && count == 60 : YELLOW;
        current_state == GREEN && count == 60 && !pedestrian : YELLOW;
        current_state == YELLOW && count == 5 : RED;
        true : current_state;
    esac;
```

**5. Outputs:**
   - Define outputs `sigG`, `sigY`, and `sigR` based on the current state to control the traffic lights.

```uclid
define sigG = (current_state == GREEN);
define sigY = (current_state == YELLOW);
define sigR = (current_state == RED || current_state == PENDING);
```

**6. Safety and Liveness Properties:**
   - You might want to add assertions or invariants to check that the traffic light behaves as expected.

```uclid
invariant (current_state == GREEN -> count <= 60);
invariant (current_state == YELLOW -> count <= 5);
```

**7. Control and Verification:**
   - Set up control commands for simulation or verification, specifying the number of steps to unroll the model or checking for specific properties.

```uclid
control {
    check;
    print_cex;
}
```

This outline provides a structured approach to modeling the traffic light system described, ensuring that all requirements are met, including the minimum green light duration and the reaction to the pedestrian button press. Adjustments may be needed based on specific verification goals or additional constraints.

assistant :: module trafficLight
{
    type state_t = enum { RED, GREEN, YELLOW, PENDING };
    var current_state : state_t;
    var count : int;
    input pedestrian : boolean;

    init {
        current_state = RED;
        count = 0;
    }

    next(count) := if (current_state == GREEN && pedestrian && count >= 60) || current_state == YELLOW then 0 else count + 1;

    next(current_state) :=
        case
            current_state == RED && count == 60 : GREEN;
            current_state == GREEN && pedestrian && count >= 60 : PENDING;
            current_state == PENDING && count == 60 : YELLOW;
            current_state == GREEN && count == 60 && !pedestrian : YELLOW;
            current_state == YELLOW && count == 5 : RED;
            true : current_state;
        esac;

    define sigG = (current_state == GREEN);
    define sigY = (current_state == YELLOW);
    define sigR = (current_state == RED || current_state == PENDING);

    /* safety */
    invariant (current_state == GREEN -> count <= 60);
    invariant (current_state == YELLOW -> count <= 5);

    control {
        check;
        print_cex;
    }
}
