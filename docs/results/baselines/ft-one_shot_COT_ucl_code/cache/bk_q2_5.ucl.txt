user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

Here's an outline for modeling the mutual exclusion protocol described using UCLID5:

--OUTLINE--

**1. Model Overview:**
The model simulates a mutual exclusion protocol for two processes (P0 and P1) using a shared variable `s` and local boolean variables `y0` and `y1`. The protocol ensures that only one process can enter the critical section at any given time.

**2. Variables:**
- Shared variable:
  * `s` : {0, 1} (indicating which process is trying to enter or is in the critical section)
- Local variables for each process:
  * `y0`, `y1` : Boolean (indicate if the respective process is attempting to enter the critical section)

**3. Initialization:**
- `s` is initialized to 1.
- Both `y0` and `y1` are initialized to 0.

**4. Process Model:**
Each process Pi (i = 0, 1) can be modeled as follows:
- **Noncritical Section:** Execution without constraints.
- **Attempt Section (l2):** Atomically sets `yi` to 1 and `s` to i.
- **Wait Section (l3):** Waits until `(y1-i == 0) || (s != i)`.
- **Critical Section:** Marked specifically to check mutual exclusion.
- **Exit Section (l5):** Sets `yi` to 0.

**5. Parallel Composition:**
The processes P0 and P1 run in parallel, each executing the loop forever. This is modeled using interleaved steps in UCLID5, where each step of P0 and P1 can interleave with each other.

**6. Properties:**
- **Mutual Exclusion:** Ensure that both processes are not in the critical section simultaneously. This can be checked using an assertion:
  ```
  assert !(P0.in_critical_section && P1.in_critical_section);
  ```
- **Starvation Freedom:** Ensure that if a process wishes to enter the critical section, it eventually does. This can be modeled by checking that if a process sets `yi` to 1, it must eventually reach the critical section. This requires tracking attempts to enter and successful entries:
  ```
  assert G(F (P0.wants_to_enter -> F P0.in_critical_section));
  assert G(F (P1.wants_to_enter -> F P1.in_critical_section));
  ```
  Here, `G` stands for globally (always) and `F` for eventually.

**7. Model Checking:**
- Use bounded model checking to verify the properties.
- Define scenarios where each process attempts to enter the critical section multiple times.
- Check for counterexamples that violate the properties.

**8. Simulation and Counterexamples:**
- If the model checker finds a violation of the properties, analyze the counterexamples to understand the conditions under which the protocol fails.
- Adjust the model or the protocol based on insights from the counterexamples.

This outline provides a structured approach to model the mutual exclusion protocol using UCLID5, focusing on critical properties such as mutual exclusion and starvation freedom.
