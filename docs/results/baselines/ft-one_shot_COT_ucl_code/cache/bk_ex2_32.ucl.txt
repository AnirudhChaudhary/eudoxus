system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To build a UCLID5 model for the described communication system with sender (S), receiver (R), and channels (c and d), we will outline the model in several parts, including submodules for S and R, and the main module to handle interactions and protocol logic. Here's an outline for the UCLID5 model:

### Outline of the UCLID5 Model

#### Data Types and Constants
1. **Message Type**: Define a data type for the messages.
   ```uclid
   type message_t;
   ```
2. **Control Bit Type**: Define a boolean type for the control bit.
   ```uclid
   type control_bit_t = boolean;
   ```

#### Modules
1. **Sender Module (S)**
   - **Inputs**:
     - `ack_bit`: The control bit from the receiver's acknowledgement.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `msg_out`: The message being sent.
     - `control_out`: The control bit sent with the message.
   - **Variables**:
     - `current_control_bit`: Stores the current state of the control bit.
     - `waiting_for_ack`: A boolean indicating if the sender is waiting for an acknowledgement.
   - **Procedures**:
     - `send_message(m: message_t)`: Sends a message with the current control bit.
     - `receive_ack(ack_bit: control_bit_t)`: Processes the received acknowledgement.
   - **Init**:
     - Initialize `current_control_bit` and `waiting_for_ack`.
   - **Next**:
     - If `waiting_for_ack` is false, send a new message.
     - If `waiting_for_ack` is true and the timeout occurs, resend the message.
     - Update `current_control_bit` upon receiving an acknowledgement.

2. **Receiver Module (R)**
   - **Inputs**:
     - `msg_in`: The message received.
     - `control_in`: The control bit received with the message.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `ack_out`: The acknowledgement sent back to the sender.
   - **Procedures**:
     - `receive_message(msg_in: message_t, control_in: control_bit_t)`: Processes the received message and sends an acknowledgement.
   - **Init**:
     - No specific initialization required.
   - **Next**:
     - Send an acknowledgement whenever a new message is received.

#### Main Module
- **Variables**:
  - `channel_c`: Array or buffer to simulate the unreliable channel c.
  - `channel_d`: Array or buffer to simulate the perfect channel d.
- **Instances**:
  - `sender`: Instance of the Sender module.
  - `receiver`: Instance of the Receiver module.
- **Init**:
  - Initialize channels and module instances.
- **Next**:
  - Simulate the transmission over channel c, including possible message loss.
  - Simulate the perfect transmission over channel d.
  - Update sender and receiver states based on the channel conditions and acknowledgements.
- **Invariant**:
  - Check that every distinct message sent by the sender is eventually received by the receiver, respecting the protocol rules.

#### Control and Verification
- **Control Flow**:
  - Model the send-and-wait protocol with timeouts and retransmissions.
  - Model the behavior of the unreliable channel c and the perfect channel d.
- **Verification Goals**:
  - Prove that the protocol ensures reliable message delivery despite the unreliability of channel c.
  - Verify that the control bits are used correctly to manage message acknowledgements and retransmissions.

This outline provides a structured approach to modeling the described communication protocol in UCLID5, focusing on accurately capturing the interactions between the sender, receiver, and the channels, as well as ensuring the reliability and correctness of the communication protocol.
