====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
Here's an outline for building a UCLID5 model that simulates the parallel execution of three processes (P1, P2, and P3), each incrementing a shared integer variable `x` using a sequence of LOAD, INC, and STORE operations. The goal is to model these operations and check if there exists an execution where the final value of `x` is 2.

### Model Outline

#### 1. Type Definitions
Define any necessary types, such as an enumeration for the process states or identifiers.

#### 2. Global Variables
- `x` : integer to represent the shared variable.
- `pc1`, `pc2`, `pc3` : program counters for processes P1, P2, and P3 to track their execution stages.

#### 3. Functions and Procedures
Define functions or procedures to represent the LOAD, INC, and STORE operations:
- `LOAD(x)`: A function that reads the value of `x`.
- `INC(x)`: A function that increments the value of `x`.
- `STORE(x)`: A function that writes the value back to `x`.

#### 4. Process Modeling
Model each process P1, P2, and P3 using a sequence of states and transitions:
- Each process should execute the sequence LOAD, INC, STORE ten times.
- Use a loop with a counter to model the repetitions.
- Ensure that each operation (LOAD, INC, STORE) is modeled as a separate step in the state machine of each process.

#### 5. Initialization
- Initialize `x` to 0.
- Set the initial states of `pc1`, `pc2`, and `pc3`.

#### 6. Transition Relations
- Define the transition relation for each process, ensuring that the operations are executed in the correct order.
- Introduce non-determinism to simulate the interleaving of operations between the processes.

#### 7. Safety Property
Define a property to check if there exists an execution that results in `x` being 2 at the end of all operations by all processes:
- This could be a simple assertion checking the value of `x` after all processes have completed their execution.

#### 8. Bounded Model Checking
- Configure the model checker to explore the state space up to a certain depth, sufficient to cover all possible interleavings and repetitions of the operations by the three processes.

#### 9. Counterexample Generation
- If the property is violated (i.e., there exists a scenario where `x` equals 2), generate a counterexample to understand the sequence of operations that led to this outcome.

### Example UCLID5 Code Snippet
This snippet provides a basic structure. You will need to expand it with detailed transitions and state updates.

```uclid
module main {
    type state_t;
    var x : int;
    var pc1, pc2, pc3 : state_t;

    init {
        x = 0;
        pc1 = start;
        pc2 = start;
        pc3 = start;
    }

    next {
        // Model the transitions for each process
    }

    control {
        // Set up bounded model checking
    }

    property terminal_x_is_2 {
        x == 2
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
This outline sets the foundation for building a UCLID5 model to simulate the given parallel program. The key challenge is accurately modeling the interleaving of the LOAD, INC, and STORE operations among the processes and verifying the final value of the shared variable `x`.
