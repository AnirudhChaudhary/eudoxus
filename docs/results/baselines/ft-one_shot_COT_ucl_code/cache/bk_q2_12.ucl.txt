system :: You're an expert in writing uclid5 models.You will be given a docstring and asked to write a model. Remember uclid5 is a state machine language and has it's own specific syntax.
====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
    This UCLID5 model simulates a process interaction environment to evaluate confidentiality properties through non-interference simulations, inspired by an example in Chapter 17 on Security from "Introduction to Embedded Systems" by Lee & Seshia. The model consists of two types of process modules (`process1` and `process2`) and a main module that orchestrates the interaction between instances of these processes.

    Process Modules:
    1. `process1`: This module captures a simplified process that reflects non-deterministic behavior based on public input. It uses an enumerated type `pc_t` with a single state `A`. It has:
        - Inputs:
        * `s`: A boolean representing a secret input.
        * `x`: A boolean representing a public input.
        - Output:
        * `z`: A boolean public output that toggles based on the inverse of input `x`.
        - Behavior:
        * The process starts in state `A` and outputs `z` as `false` initially.
        * In subsequent cycles, the output `z` becomes the negation of `x`.

    2. `process2`: This module is a more complex process with an internal state machine described using state enum `pc_t` with states `B` and `C`. It demonstrates state-dependent output behavior.
        - Inputs are the same as in `process1`.
        - Output and state transitions:
        * The process starts in state `B` with the output `z` as `false`.
        * Based on the input combination (state, `s`, and `x`), the process transitions between states `B` and `C`, toggling the output `z`.
        * The transitions are specifically:
            - From `B` to `C` (output `z` is set to `true`) when `s` is true and `x` is false.
            - From `C` back to `B` (output `z` is reset to `false`) under the same input conditions.

    Main Module:
    - Sets up instances of `process2` (`p21` and `p22`) to interact under controlled input conditions.
    - Inputs `x1`, `x2` (public), and `s1`, `s2` (secret) are used for driving the process instances.
    - Controls non-determinism by initially assuming both `x1` and `x2` are equal, and it maintains this assumption in all subsequent states.
    - Evaluates confidentiality by asserting the invariant `same_output_z`, ensuring that outputs `z1` and `z2` of both process instances are always equal, thereby checking for consistent behavior across different runs with potentially varying secret inputs.

    Control:
    - The control block is used to perform bounded model checking and to produce counterexamples. It specifies that up to 5 unrolling should be checked.
    - The `print_cex` function is used for displaying counterexamples for the states of inputs and outputs along with the internal state of `process2` instances (`p21` and `p22`).

    This model is particularly useful for demonstrating the effects of secret data manipulations on the outputs, which can be analyzed to study security vulnerability or proof of non-interference in systems.

====================
user :: Write a uclid5 model for the following description:
To outline the UCLID5 model for the leader election protocol in a ring topology using n processes, we will define the system as a channel system where each process communicates through unidirectional channels. We will represent each process and the channels as separate modules and then integrate these in a main module that simulates the entire ring topology and the election algorithm.

--OUTLINE--

### 1. Process Module
Each process `Pi` will be represented as a module with the following characteristics:
- **Variables**:
  - `id`: an integer constant assigned uniquely to each process.
  - `m`: an integer variable to store the message received from the previous process.
  - `status`: a boolean to indicate whether the process has stopped (elected leader or acknowledged leader).
- **Initialization**:
  - `m` is initialized to 0 (indicating no message).
  - `status` is initialized to `false`.
- **Transitions**:
  - **Sending**: Each process initially sends its `id` to the next process in the ring.
  - **Receiving and Decision**:
    - If `m = id`, then set `status` to `true` (indicating that the process stops as it is or recognizes the leader).
    - If `m > id`, forward `m` to the next process.
    - If `m < id`, do nothing (wait for the next message).
- **Outputs**:
  - Each process outputs its current `id`, `m`, and `status` for debugging and verification purposes.

### 2. Channel Module
Channels between processes will be modeled to carry messages:
- **Variables**:
  - `msg`: an integer to carry the message from one process to another.
- **Functions**:
  - `send(m)`: function to send a message `m` to the next process.
  - `receive()`: function to receive a message from the previous process.

### 3. Main Module
The main module integrates all processes and channels, simulating the ring topology:
- **Array of Processes**: Create an array `processes[1..n]` of the process module.
- **Array of Channels**: Create an array `channels[1..n]` where `channels[i]` connects `processes[i]` to `processes[(i % n) + 1]`.
- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize each process and channel.
  - Start the leader election by having each process send its `id` through its corresponding channel.
- **Simulation Loop**:
  - Each process receives messages through its incoming channel.
  - Based on the received message and its own `id`, the process decides whether to stop or forward the message.
  - Continue until all processes have either stopped or acknowledged the leader.
- **Properties to Verify**:
  - Check that only one process (the one with the highest `id`) eventually has `status` set to `true` and others recognize it.
  - Ensure that the system eventually stabilizes (no messages are in transit).

### 4. Verification and Properties
- **Safety Properties**:
  - Ensure no two processes claim to be the leader.
  - Validate that the elected leader has the highest `id`.
- **Liveness Properties**:
  - Ensure that the protocol eventually terminates with a leader elected.

This model provides a framework for simulating and verifying the leader election protocol in a ring topology using UCLID5, focusing on safety and liveness properties critical for distributed systems.
